== Gatekeeper

Continuous integration acts as the gatekeeper for your pipeline — if any checks fail, nothing else moves forward.

NOTE: Bonus: the computer plays the bad cop, saving you time during reviews!

=== Dependencies & Artifacts

[%step]
* Dependency management
* Anything that's generated for your app
** Compiled and/or minified files
** Binaries
* Source control should only worry about the _source_

[.notes]
--
Adding Continuous Integration also gives us an opportunity to remove dependencies and artifacts from our repository.

Instead of trying to version third-party libraries we depend on, use a dependency manager (npm, Composer, RubyGems, Maven, etc.) to bring these in.

Artifacts are the things that we build, but aren't *source* — anything generated by Webpack, compiled binaries, etc. If we can run a script to re-create them, get them out of the repo!

CI can rebuild + cache these as necessary. Smaller repos, less chance of conflict.

=== Continuous Delivery

[%step]
* Being able to be deploy on-demand
* One-click deployments

[.notes]
--
Continuous Delivery means that we're able to deploy the application at any time, typically through a one-click deployment.

Every necessary step has been scripted, so deployments are as painless as clicking a big "deploy" button.

Scripting everything = nobody can forget a step.

=== Delivery vs. Deployment

image::continuous-delivery-deployment-tweet.png[Tweet from @ccaum from August 2013: "Continuous Delivery doesn't mean every change is deployed to production ASAP. It means every change is proven to be deployable at any time",link=https://twitter.com/ccaum/status/372620989257232384]

=== Delivery vs. Deployment

[%step]
* *Delivery* 
** Some manual step to deploy
* *Deployment* 
** Always Be Deployin'

[.notes]
--
Most of the pipeline for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment will look the same — build the app, run our tests, deploy to staging — all of that will be automatic.

The key is going to prod: continuous DELIVERY requires some manual intervention, whereas continuous DEPLOYMENT will be automatic

=== Friday

[.notes]
--
It's popular for developers to talk about how we should *never* deploy on Fridays, but that fear feels misplaced.

Continuous delivery means we _can_ deploy any time we want to, because we've automated the process and built in the necessary checks to make sure everything works as we expect.

Still uneasy? Figure out why => good indicator of what needs attention.

=== Deploy with Confidence!

In order to deploy confidently,<br>we must have confidence in our tools.

[.notes]
--
If you don't want to be afraid of Friday deployments, it's important to have confidence in the tools you're using.

You don't *have* to deploy on Fridays, but the idea of doing so shouldn't give you nightmares. Don't worry: I won't tell your boss.
