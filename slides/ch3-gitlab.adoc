==  Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline

[.notes]
--
Now that we have a sense of what continuous integration and delivery are, let's see how we can incorporate it to our projects:
--

=== What is a Pipeline?

[%step]
* A route from development to production
* Different branches may take different paths

[.notes]
--
A pipeline, not unlike the internet, is a series of tubes.

Pipelines define the route from a developer's local machine to production. Which steps does it need to take? What gates are in place?

Different branches may also take different routes — maybe the "staging" branch never goes to prod, but only represents an internal staging server?
--

=== CI/CD Providers

[%step]
* Jenkins
* Travis CI
* Circle CI
* Codeship
* DeployBot
* Github (Github Actions)
* Gitlab

[.notes]
--
There are a bunch of CI/CD providers, and they offer varying sets of features.

Many developers may be familiar or already using Jenkins.

Travis CI is well-known among GitHub users.

Some platforms even provide their own tools, including Bitbucket and what we're going to be using today: GitLab.

=== What is Github Actions ?

[.refs]
--
https://github.com/features/actions
--

[.notes]
--
GitHub Actions is an API for cause and effect on GitHub: orchestrate any workflow, based on any event, while GitHub manages the execution, provides rich feedback, and secures every step along the way
--

=== Workflow

1. Event 
2. Trigger
3. Do something

=== What kind of Triggers?

[.small]
--
* Push
* Pull request
* create tag
* create branch
* Issue comment created
* Issue labeled applied
* Issue is opened
* Make private repo public
* Scheduled

=== Pipeline configuration


`.github/workflows/ci.yml`

[.notes]
--
Github keeps its configuration in `.github` Other providers will typically have similar files.

By keeping the configuration as code, you're able to version it and it's kept along with the repository.

=== Pipeline configuration

[source,yml]
----
name: ci
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8]

    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      uses: actions/setup-python@v2

* This workflow fires on two kinds of events: pushes to the master branch and PRs to the master branch. Each PR will have an automatic CI run for each change (every new commit pushed).
* It runs in multiple configurations: the cartesian-product of Python versions and OSes, as specified.
* The run: entry is the command the runs the tests.
* While the code may not have any dependencies, it's easy to have those too by adding pip install $whatever lines to run: before the actual test execution line.

=== image:gitlab.png[GitLab,link=https://gitlab.com]

[%step]
* Source code management tool
* Hosted platform or available for private installation
* Includes CI/CD tools!

[.notes]
--
At its core, GitLab is a source code management tool like GitHub or Bitbucket. They've also built a series of tools around it to create an integrated platform for software development.

It's available at GitLab.com or you can download its source and run your own GitLab instance.

Great CI/CD tools available for free!

=== GitLab CI/CD Tools

[%step]
* Define multiple **stages** (build, test, deploy, etc.)
* Each stage has one or more **jobs**
* Multiple runners == run jobs in parallel!

[.notes]
--
Some terminology: GitLab lets us define one or more *stages* in our pipelines. Typically, these will be something like: "install dependencies and build the app", "run our tests", then "deploy to target servers" (totally flexible)

Each stage is comprised of one or more "jobs" (e.g. "run unit tests")

Jobs are carried out by runners, and we can run multiple jobs in the same stage in parallel if we have multiple runners, which speeds up the pipeline.

=== A Typical Pipeline

image::pipeline-gitlab.png[A GitLab pipeline, describing 8 jobs across three stages (build, test, and deploy)]

[.notes]
--
Pretty typical pipeline for a Laravel app:

- Build stage where we install npm and composer dependencies
- Test stage: check coding standards, Jest for JS tests, PHPUnit for PHP unit and integration tests, and static code analysis via PHPStan
- Deploy stage: continuous deployment for staging, continuous delivery for production

By default, GitLab keeps is configuration in .gitlab-ci.yml. Other providers will typically have similar files.

By keeping the configuration as code, you're able to version it and it's kept along with the repository.
--

=== A simple job

[source,yaml]
--
Install npm dependencies: 
    stage: build 
    script:
        - npm install --no-progress
        - npm run prod 
    artifacts:
        paths:
            - public 
    cache:
        key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}-npm
        paths:
            - node_modules
--

[.notes]
--
A common task: installing dependencies. This will typically fall under the "build" stage.

We'll install the dependencies, then run an npm script that calls webpack to build everything, just as we would locally.

We're telling GitLab that we want to hold onto what's generated into the public/ directory, since Webpack just built all of it.

We can also cache node_modules with the current commit, so if we need to re-run this it'll go faster for us.
--

=== &hellip;And So much more!

[%step]
* `image`
* `only` + `except`
* `dependencies`
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/[docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml]

[.notes]
--
There are a ton of different parameters available to streamline your build.

`image` lets us use pre-built Docker images, so you can build exactly what you need to test.

`only` and `except` let us control the creation of jobs, making sure we're not wasting time and resources. Example: only run E2E tests on master.

`dependencies` lets us say "this job depends on that one passing" to help order things and prevent duplication.
--

=== Environment Variables

image::environment-variables.png[The "Environment Variables" configuration for GitLab's CI/CD pipelines]

[.notes]
--
Storing pipeline configs in repo is great, but we don't want our secrets (API keys, database passwords, SSH keys, etc.) exposed there.

Instead, store them as environment variables for the CI/CD pipeline within GitLab.

Can also mask keys to keep them out of logs and/or only make them available to protected branches (e.g. master)
