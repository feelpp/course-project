== Extending our Pipelines

[.notes]
--
Once we have the basics in place, we can take our pipelines further.

Won't dive too deep, as each of these things could be a talk of their own!

=== Blue-Green Deployments

[%step]
* Run multiple production environments/servers
** Some active (blue), some idle (green)
* Deploy to green
* Once ready, route traffic to green
** Blue becomes idle
* In case of issues, re-route to blue

[.notes]
--
This is a more advanced deployment scheme, wherein we have multiple production environments.

Simple example: two servers (blue and green) and a load balancer.
* All traffic is currently going to blue.

* Deploy + test in green environment.
* When ready, route traffic to green.
* Next deployment works the same, but goes to blue instead.
* If something went wrong, re-route from green to blue.

In summary, your load balancer is basically playing a shell game.

=== Building a Docker Image

[%step]
* Final product: a Docker image of your app
* Great for Docker-powered production clusters!

[.notes]
--
If you're using something like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, you could also use the CI pipeline to literally build a Docker image of your app.

Also makes it easier to do "canary" releases, where maybe only 20% of traffic gets sent to the latest version of the app.

=== Generate Documentation

Automatically parse + release documentation!

[.notes]
--
Another idea might be to automatically run JSDoc, PHPdocumentor, or anything else you might use to generate documentation from your codebase and publish it.

Anything you can script can be run as part of the pipeline!
--

=== Code Coverage Reports

[%step]
* Generate code coverage as part of the CI pipeline
* Help identify branches that reduce code coverage

[.notes]
--
You may also calculate code coverage reports as part of the CI pipeline.

Not only can these be turned into badges (useful for READMEs), but it can also help identify branches that *reduce* coverage.
--

=== Notifications

[%step]
* GitLab CI/CD supports webhooks
* Can be used to post to Slack, send emails, and more!

[.notes]
--
GitLab's CI/CD tooling supports webhooks, which means you can tie into different events.

Maybe you want to post to a Slack channel any time a deployment goes out, or tag a release in your analytics tool. We can script all sorts of extra actions depending on the success or failure of different jobs and stages.
