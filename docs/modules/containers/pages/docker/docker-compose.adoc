== Docker Compose: Orchestrating Containers

Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the process of managing multiple containers as a single service. With Docker Compose, you can define all the services your application needs in a single YAML file and start them with a single command.

=== Why Docker Compose?

- **Multi-container applications**: It simplifies managing applications that require multiple services like a web server, database, and cache.
- **Declarative configuration**: Compose uses a declarative `docker-compose.yml` file to describe the services, volumes, networks, and configurations needed.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all containers in a service are started in the correct order with the proper dependencies.
- **Portability**: Easily share and distribute your configuration across different environments (development, testing, and production).

=== Getting Started with Docker Compose

First, ensure that Docker Compose is installed on your system. You can verify this by running:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose --version
----

If it’s not installed, follow the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

=== Writing a `docker-compose.yml` File

Here’s a simple example of a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines a web application with two services: a web server and a database.

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
----

=== Running Docker Compose

To start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file, navigate to the directory containing the file and run:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up
----

This will start both the web server and the database as defined. If you want to run them in detached mode (in the background), use:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

=== Common Docker Compose Commands

- **Starting containers**: 
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up
----
- **Stopping containers**: 
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose down
----
- **Viewing running services**: 
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose ps
----
- **Rebuilding services after changes**: 
[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up --build
----

=== Conclusion

Docker Compose is an essential tool for orchestrating multi-container applications. It simplifies the process of defining, running, and managing multiple services, making it a great choice for development and production environments.
