Docker is an open platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. This makes it easy to manage and scale applications across different environments.

== What is a Container?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages code and all its dependencies, ensuring the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

- Containers isolate the application environment.
- Unlike VMs, containers share the host system's OS kernel, making them lightweight.
