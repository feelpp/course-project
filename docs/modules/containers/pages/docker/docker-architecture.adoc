== Separation of Concerns

Docker separates the roles of developers and sysadmins by using containers as the interface between these roles. 

This concept is particularly valuable for **scientific computing** and **data science**, where developers can create isolated environments that encapsulate complex computational workflows, ensuring reproducibility. 

For **scientific ML** and **digital twins**, containers help streamline model deployment, making it easier to manage models across different computational platforms, from HPC clusters to edge devices.

== Containers vs VMs

Containers use fewer resources since they share the OS kernel, a crucial advantage in **scientific computing** and **scientific ML**, where heavy computation demands efficiency.

**Digital twins** can simulate real-world environments more effectively with containers, ensuring that resource allocation is optimized for simulation fidelity.

== Lightweight by Design

Docker's lightweight design makes it useful for **scientific computing** pipelines, where iterative and resource-heavy processes (e.g., simulations, ML model training) require quick and flexible deployment.

**Digital twins** benefit from Dockerâ€™s efficiency by allowing rapid iteration of simulations without the overhead of traditional virtual machines, improving performance when running real-time applications.
