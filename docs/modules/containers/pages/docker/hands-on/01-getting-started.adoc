The basic components of the Docker system are:
- **Images**: Blueprints of the application and its dependencies.
- **Containers**: Running instances of images.
- **Volumes**: Persistent data storage.
- **Networks**: Isolated environments for containers to communicate.
- **Dockerfile**: A file used to create Docker images.

== Docker Hello World Example

[source,shell]
----
docker run hello-world
----

This command pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container.

== Running Ubuntu in a Container

[source,shell]
----
docker run -it ubuntu bash
----

The `-it` flag starts the container in interactive mode with a terminal attached. This runs an Ubuntu image with the Bash shell.
