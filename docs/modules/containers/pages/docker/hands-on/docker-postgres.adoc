= Using the Postgres Docker Official Image

This section explains how to work with the Postgres Docker Official Image to set up a Postgres container quickly and efficiently.

== Why Use Postgres in Docker?

- Quick and easy setup.
- Better isolation between the application and database.
- Easier to spin up in various environments (local development, testing, etc.).

== Pulling the Postgres Image

You can pull the Postgres image from Docker Hub with:

[source,shell]
----
docker pull postgres
----

To use a specific version, add the version tag (e.g., `:14.5`).

== Running Postgres in a Container

To start a Postgres container with environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
----

== Using Docker Compose

You can manage multiple services, including Postgres, with Docker Compose. Here is a basic `docker-compose.yml` example:

This Docker Compose file defines a two-service setup using PostgreSQL and Adminer. Below is a breakdown of each section:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  db:                                               // <1>
    image: postgres                                 // <2>
    environment:                                    // <3>
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example                    // <4>
    volumes:                                        // <5>
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data             // <6>

  adminer:                                          // <7>
    image: adminer                                  // <8>
    ports:                                          // <9>
      - "8080:8080"                                 // <10>

volumes:
  pgdata:                                           // <11>
----

<1> **db**: Defines the first service, a PostgreSQL database.
<2> **image: postgres**: Uses the official PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub.
<3> **environment**: Sets environment variables for the database configuration.
<4> **POSTGRES_PASSWORD**: Sets the password for the PostgreSQL database.
<5> **volumes**: Configures a persistent volume for data storage.
<6> **pgdata**: Maps the host volume `pgdata` to the container's data directory, ensuring data persistence.
<7> **adminer**: Defines the second service, Adminer, a lightweight database management interface.
<8> **image: adminer**: Uses the official Adminer image from Docker Hub.
<9> **ports**: Maps ports between the host and the container.
<10> **"8080:8080"**: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 inside the container for accessing Adminer.
<11> **volumes**: Defines the named volume `pgdata` for persisting PostgreSQL data.

.What is Adminer?
[TIP]
====
*Adminer* is a lightweight and full-featured database management tool, available as a single PHP file. It supports managing databases like **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **SQLite**, and others, offering a user-friendly web interface for performing various database operations, such as running queries, editing tables, and managing users.

In Docker environments, Adminer is commonly used alongside databases like PostgreSQL to provide a simple, browser-based management interface.

== Extending the Postgres Image

You can customize your Postgres container by using:

- **Environment variables** for configuration (e.g., `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`).
- **Docker secrets** to handle sensitive data securely.
- **Initialization scripts** to automate database setup.

== Conclusion

The Postgres Docker Official Image simplifies the deployment of PostgreSQL databases. Whether used for local development or small-scale production, Docker makes it easy to manage and extend Postgres instances.
