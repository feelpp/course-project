= Advanced Docker Usage

== Volumes: Persistent Storage

Use volumes to store data that persists even after a container is removed. Hereâ€™s an example of running an Ubuntu container with a mounted volume from your local `/tmp` directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -it -v /tmp:/tmp ubuntu bash
----

You can view the volume by running the `df` command inside the container.

== Docker Images and Updates

Docker images can be updated and modified easily by creating new image layers. The ability to roll back and forward to different layers simplifies testing and updates.
