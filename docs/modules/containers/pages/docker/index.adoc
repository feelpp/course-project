== Quick Start

If you're in a hurry, here's the minimum path:

[source,text]
----
1. Install Docker       → 15 min
2. Basic commands       → 30 min  
3. Dockerfile basics    → 45 min
4. GitHub Actions       → 30 min
                        --------
   Total:                 2 hours

== Module Contents

=== Concepts (Why Containers?)

xref:what-are-containers.adoc[**What are Containers?**]::
Understand containers vs. VMs, images vs. containers, OCI standards.

xref:docker-problems-solved.adoc[**Problems Docker Solves**]::
The "matrix from hell", reproducibility challenges, and how Docker addresses them.

xref:docker-architecture.adoc[**Docker Architecture**]::
Client-server model, Docker daemon, registries, and how containers work.

=== Hands-On Skills

xref:docker-install.adoc[**Installation Guide**]::
Install Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux).

xref:docker-commands.adoc[**Essential Commands**]::
`docker run`, `docker build`, `docker exec`, volumes, ports, and more.

xref:dockerfile-basics.adoc[**Dockerfile Fundamentals**]::
Create custom images for your mathematical computing projects.

=== Advanced Topics

xref:hands-on/04-compose.adoc[**Docker Compose**]::
Orchestrate multi-container applications (e.g., Jupyter + database).

xref:hands-on/06-githubactions.adoc[**GitHub Actions + Docker**]::
Automate image building and publishing with CI/CD.

== Why Docker for Mathematics Students?

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Challenge | Docker Solution

| *"Works on my machine"*
| Package exact versions of Python, NumPy, MATLAB in a container

| *Complex dependencies*
| Dockerfile captures all setup steps reproducibly

| *Sharing research*
| `docker pull yourimage` gives collaborators your exact environment

| *HPC deployment*
| Build locally, run on clusters (via Apptainer/Singularity)

| *Long-term preservation*
| Archive container images with published papers
|===

== Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:

[%interactive]
* [ ] Basic Linux command-line skills (cd, ls, mkdir)
* [ ] A computer with 8GB+ RAM and 20GB+ free disk space
* [ ] Administrator/sudo access for installation
* [ ] A GitHub account (for the Actions tutorial)
