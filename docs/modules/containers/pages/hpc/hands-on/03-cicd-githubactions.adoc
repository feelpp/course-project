In this session, you will create a simple GitHub Actions workflow that automates the configuration, building, and testing of your HPC application using CMake presets. 
This workflow runs on a runner labeled `self-ubuntu-24.04`. Each step is explained with callouts.

== Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn to:

- Check out your repository.
- Configure the build system using CMake presets.
- Build the project with CMake.
- Run tests using CTest.
- Understand each step through detailed callouts.

== GitHub Actions Workflow

Below is the complete YAML for the workflow, with callouts explaining each section:

[source,yaml]
----
name: CI - Configure, Build, Test                   # <1>

on:
  push:                                             # <2>
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:                                     # <3>
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:                                # <4>

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: self-ubuntu-24.04                      # <5>
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository                   # <6>
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure the Build System            # <7>
        run: |
          cmake --preset default                    # <8>

      - name: Build the Project                     # <9>
        run: |
          cmake --build --preset default            # <10>

      - name: Run Tests                             # <11>
        run: |
          ctest --preset default                    # <12>
----
<1> **Workflow Name:** A descriptive title for this CI workflow.
<2> **Trigger on Push:** The workflow will run when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
<3> **Trigger on Pull Request:** The workflow also runs for pull requests targeting `main`.
<4> **Manual Trigger:** Enables manual execution via GitHub Actions UI (Workflow Dispatch).
<5> **Runner Specification:** This job runs on a runner labeled `self-ubuntu-24.04`.
<6> **Checkout Step:** Clones your repository into the workflow environment.
<7> **Configure Build Step:** Prepares the build environment using CMake presets.
<8> **CMake Configuration:** Runs CMake with the default preset (as defined in your CMakePresets.json).
<9> **Build Step:** Compiles the project using the configured presets.
<10> **CMake Build:** Executes the build process.
<11> **Test Step:** Runs the tests using CTest with the preset configuration.
<12> **CTest Execution:** Validates the build by running tests.

== Running the Workflow

To trigger this workflow:
- **Push a commit** to the `main` branch.
- **Open a pull request** targeting `main`.
- **Manually trigger** the workflow via the GitHub Actions tab (using Workflow Dispatch).

== Add step to install the application

To install the application, add the following step to the workflow:

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: Package the Application
        run: |
          cmake --build --preset default -t install
----

== Add step to package the application

To package the application, add the following step to the workflow:

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: Package the Application
        run: |
          cmake --build --preset default -t package
----

== Matrix strategy to build on multiple platforms

We now want to run the same set of steps on two different environments: `self-ubuntu-24.04` and `karolina`. 

This can be achieved using a matrix strategy.

The new workflow utilizes a matrix strategy to run the same set of steps on different environments. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Matrix Definition::
  The `strategy.matrix` key defines a variable `runs-on` with two possible values: `self-ubuntu-24.04` and `karolina`. This means that for each push, the job will run twice, once on each specified environment.

Conditional Module Loading::
  Since the `karolina` environment requires specific module loads (e.g., Boost, Ninja, OpenMPI), the workflow checks the value of `${{ matrix.runs-on }}`. If it equals `karolina`, the required modules are loaded before configuring, building, testing, or packaging.

Single Workflow, Multiple Targets::
  By using the matrix strategy, you can verify that your code builds correctly in both your local Codespace environment (`self-ubuntu-24.04`) and the HPC environment on Karolina. This ensures consistency and helps identify environment-specific issues.

This approach allows you to maintain one workflow that automatically adapts to different platforms, simplifying the management of CI/CD pipelines across varied environments.

Below is the complete YAML for the workflow, with callouts explaining each section:

[source,yaml]
----
name: CI - Configure, Build, Test, and Package           # <1>

on:
  push:                                                 # <2>
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:                                         # <3>
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:                                    # <4>

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        runs-on: [self-ubuntu-24.04, karolina]           # <5>
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository                       # <6>
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build                                        # <7>
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.runs-on }}" == "karolina" ]; then
            module load Boost/1.83.0-GCC-13.2.0 Ninja/1.12.1-GCCcore-13.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.6-GCC-13.2.0
          fi
          cmake --preset default                           # <8>
          cmake --build --preset default                   # <9>

      - name: Test                                         # <10>
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.runs-on }}" == "karolina" ]; then
            module load Boost/1.83.0-GCC-13.2.0 Ninja/1.12.1-GCCcore-13.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.6-GCC-13.2.0
          fi
          ctest --preset default                           # <11>

      - name: Package                                      # <12>
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.runs-on }}" == "karolina" ]; then
            module load Boost/1.83.0-GCC-13.2.0 Ninja/1.12.1-GCCcore-13.3.0 OpenMPI/4.1.6-GCC-13.2.0
          fi
          cmake --build --preset default -t package         # <13>

== Add a step to upload the package

We now want to upload the generated package as an artifact.
To do so we use the `actions/upload-artifact` action.

[source,yaml]
----
        - name: Upload Package                            # <1>
            uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
            with:
                name: myapp-package
----
<1> **Artifact Upload:** Uploads the generated tarball artifact (only on `self-ubuntu-24.04`).

NOTE: in vscode you can click on the action name to access its documentation using the `Ctrl` key.

== Conclusion

This workflow demonstrates how GitHub Actions can automate the repetitive tasks of configuring, building, and testing your HPC application. 
Using CMake presets ensures a consistent build environment.
