In this session, we will generate a GitHub Actions job that converts our Docker image into an Apptainer SIF file and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). Each step is explained using callouts.

== Workflow Key Steps

This job automates the conversion of your Docker image into an Apptainer SIF file and then uploads the SIF file to GHCR. 

The key steps are:

- **Authentication:** Log in to GHCR via Apptainer.
- **Conversion:** Use Apptainer to pull the Docker image and convert it to SIF.
- **Verification:** Inspect the SIF file to verify its contents.
- **Upload:** Push the SIF file back to GHCR for later deployment.


== GitHub Actions Job: Convert and Upload Apptainer SIF

Below is the complete YAML for the `build-apptainer` job:

[source,yaml]
----
build-apptainer:
    runs-on: self-apptainer                   # <1>
    needs: build-docker                       # <2>
    env:
      apptainer: /opt/apptainer/v1.4.0/apptainer/bin/apptainer   # <3>
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository             # <4>
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry  # <5>
        run: |
          ${{ env.apptainer }} remote login -u ${{ github.repository_owner }} -p ${{ secrets.GHCR_PAT }} oras://ghcr.io

      - name: Convert Docker Image to Apptainer SIF   # <6>
        run: |
          # Set the SIF filename based on the repository name.
          sif=$(basename ${{ github.repository }}.sif)
          # Pull the Docker image (tagged as 'solution') and convert it to a SIF file.
          ${{ env.apptainer }} pull -F $sif docker://ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:solution
          # Inspect the SIF file to verify its contents.
          ${{ env.apptainer }} inspect $sif

      - name: Upload Apptainer SIF to GitHub Container Registry  # <7>
        run: |
          # Determine the SIF filename.
          sif=$(basename ${{ github.repository }}.sif)
          # Push the SIF file to GHCR under the tag 'solution-sif'
          ${{ env.apptainer }} push $sif oras://ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:solution-sif
----
<1> **Runner Specification:** This job runs on a self-hosted runner labeled `self-apptainer`, which has Apptainer installed.
<2> **Job Dependency:** This job depends on the `build-docker` job; the Docker image must be built first.
<3> **Environment Variable:** The `apptainer` variable holds the path to the Apptainer binary, used in subsequent commands.
<4> **Checkout Repository:** Clones your repository so that the workflow can access necessary files and metadata.
<5> **GHCR Login:** Authenticates with GitHub Container Registry using Apptainerâ€™s remote login command. This allows the subsequent pull and push operations to access private images.
<6> **Convert Docker Image to SIF:**  
   - The SIF filename is generated from the repository name.
   - The command pulls the Docker image from GHCR (using the tag `solution`), converts it into a SIF file, and then inspects the file to ensure correctness.
<7> **Upload SIF:**  
   - The SIF file is then pushed to GHCR under a new tag (`solution-sif`), making it available for deployment on HPC systems.

== Conclusion

By automating this conversion process, you ensure that your HPC application, initially built as a Docker image, is readily available in a format (SIF) that can be deployed on supercomputers using Apptainer.  
This streamlined workflow is essential for enabling reproducible, containerized HPC deployments.
