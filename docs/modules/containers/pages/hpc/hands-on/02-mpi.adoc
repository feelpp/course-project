== Hands-on: Building and Pushing Container Images for HPC Applications

In this session, you'll learn how to:

* Build a Docker image for an MPI application inside a GitHub Codespace (running Ubuntu 24.04).
* Push the image to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io).
* Automate the build and push process using GitHub Actions CI/CD.
* Deploy the container image on the Karolina HPC system (or similar machines) using both Docker and Apptainer.

=== Prerequisites

* A GitHub Codespace based on Ubuntu 24.04.
* Docker installed in the Codespace.
* Access to GitHub Container Registry (with a Personal Access Token stored as the secret `CR_PAT`).
* Apptainer (or Singularity) installed on your target HPC system.

=== Step 1: Building an MPI Application in GitHub Codespace

We'll create a simple MPI "Hello World" application in C and package it into a Docker image using Ubuntu 24.04.

==== Sample MPI Application (app.c)

[source,c]
----
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);
    int world_size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);
    int world_rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);
    printf("Hello world from rank %d out of %d processors\n", world_rank, world_size);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
----

==== Dockerfile for the MPI Application

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your repository with the following content. Notice we use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image.
[source,dockerfile,line-comment=#]
----
FROM ubuntu:24.04                            # <1>
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive           # <2>
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    mpich \
    build-essential && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*              # <3>
COPY app.c /app/app.c                        # <4>
WORKDIR /app                                 # <5>
RUN mpicc -o mpi_app app.c                   # <6>
CMD ["mpirun", "-np", "4", "./mpi_app"]      # <7>
----
<1> Use Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image for a modern, stable environment.
<2> Set DEBIAN_FRONTEND to noninteractive to suppress prompts during package installation.
<3> Update package lists, install MPICH and build-essential packages, and clean up package cache.
<4> Copy the MPI application source code (app.c) into the /app directory in the image.
<5> Set the working directory to /app for subsequent commands.
<6> Compile the MPI application using mpicc, outputting the binary as 'mpi_app'.
<7> Define the default command to run the MPI application with 4 processes using mpirun.



==== Building the Docker Image in GitHub Codespace
Open the terminal in your Codespace (Ubuntu 24.04) and run:


[source,sh]
----
# Build the Docker image locally
docker build -t ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest .

# Run the image to test the MPI application
docker run --rm ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest
----

=== Step 2: Pushing the Image to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
Once you have verified the image, push it to ghcr.io:

[source,sh]
----
# Log in to GitHub Container Registry using your Personal Access Token (CR_PAT)
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password-stdin

# Push the Docker image to ghcr.io
docker push ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest
----

=== Step 3: Automating Builds and Pushes with GitHub Actions CI/CD
Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`) with the following content to automate the process:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Docker Build and Push

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}

      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.actor }}/mpi_app:latest
----

This workflow automatically builds and pushes your Docker image whenever changes are merged into the main branch.

=== Step 4: Deploying on Karolina HPC and Other Machines

On the Karolina HPC system (or another target machine), you can deploy the container image using Docker or convert it to an Apptainer image.

==== Deploying with Docker
Pull and run the image on the target system:

[source,sh]
----
# Log in to GitHub Container Registry if required
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password-stdin

# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest

# Run the container on an HPC node
docker run --rm ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest
----

==== Converting to an Apptainer Image
If your HPC system uses Apptainer/Singularity for container execution, convert the Docker image as follows:

[source,sh]
----
# On the HPC system, use Apptainer to pull the Docker image
apptainer pull mpi_app.sif docker://ghcr.io/<your-username>/mpi_app:latest
----

You can now run the Apptainer image on your HPC system:

[source,sh]
----
apptainer exec mpi_app.sif mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_app
----

=== Wrap-Up and Q&A

* **Review:**  
  - Built an MPI application in C and containerized it using a Dockerfile based on Ubuntu 24.04.
  - Tested and pushed the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry.
  - Automated the build/push process with GitHub Actions.
  - Demonstrated deployment on HPC systems via Docker and Apptainer.
  
* **Discussion:**  
  - How might this workflow be extended for more complex HPC applications?
  - What additional optimizations or testing (e.g., performance benchmarks) could be integrated?

Now it's time to experiment, ask questions, and explore how these tools can streamline HPC application deployment!
