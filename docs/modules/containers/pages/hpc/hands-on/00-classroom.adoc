This session introduces GitHub Classroom and Codespaces, frameworks that enable educators to deliver personalized, reproducible development environments for training sessions. These tools help ensure that every trainee starts from a consistent baseline and can focus on learning without worrying about local environment issues.

== Overview

GitHub Classroom and Codespaces together allow instructors to:

- **Automate Repository Creation:** Personalized repositories are generated for each student from a central template (e.g., *c3b-template*).
- **Provide Instant Development Environments:** Students can launch cloud-based Codespaces pre-configured with all required tools and dependencies.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Every student’s environment is identical, reducing setup issues and enabling smooth collaboration and assessment.

== GitHub Classroom

GitHub Classroom streamlines the assignment lifecycle by automating repository creation and management.

* **Key Features:**
  - **Automated Repository Creation:**  
    When an assignment is distributed, GitHub Classroom generates a personalized repository for each student using a template such as *c3b-template*. This ensures every trainee starts from the same codebase.
  - **Assignment Management:**  
    Instructors can set deadlines, provide feedback, and track student progress directly within GitHub.
  - **Version Control Integration:**  
    Students benefit from Git’s version control system, making it easier to track changes and collaborate.

* **Benefits for Training:**
  - **Uniformity:**  
    All trainees work from the same starting point, enabling a consistent learning experience.
  - **Efficiency:**  
    Automated workflows reduce the time instructors spend managing repositories.
  - **Enhanced Collaboration:**  
    Instructors and students can interact directly through pull requests, issues, and code reviews.

== GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides cloud-hosted development environments that are ready to use immediately.

* **Key Features:**
  - **Pre-configured Environments:**  
    Codespaces are built using configuration files (e.g., `devcontainer.json`) from the repository, ensuring each environment contains all necessary tools (like Docker, compilers, and MPI libraries).
  - **Accessible Anywhere:**  
    Trainees can open their Codespace directly in a web browser without needing local installations.
  - **Consistency and Reproducibility:**  
    Every Codespace uses the same OS (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04) and setup, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

* **Integration with GitHub Classroom:**
  - When a student accepts an assignment, GitHub Classroom creates a repository from *c3b-template*. This repository includes the configuration for Codespaces, so each student gets an identical, ready-to-use environment.
  - This allows trainees to dive straight into coding and learning MPI/HPC concepts, rather than spending time setting up their local environments.

== Your repository

Now check your repository and read the README.adoc instructions to start the training session.

The next steps are:

- compile the MPI application
- run the MPI application
- test the MPI application

- Repeat on Karolina using the following modules

== Summary

By combining GitHub Classroom with Codespaces:

- Instructors can automatically generate personalized repositories using the *c3b-template*.
- Trainees receive a fully configured, cloud-based development environment that is consistent across the board.
- The focus shifts from environment setup to learning and developing HPC applications, making the training experience smoother and more effective.
