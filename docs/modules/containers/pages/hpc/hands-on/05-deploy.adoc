This session demonstrates how to deploy your Apptainer image to run a parallel MPI job on two environments: a local runner (`self-ubuntu-24.04`) and the Karolina HPC system. We will also show how to automatically trigger the deploy job when the Apptainer image is updated.

== Overview

In this session, you will learn:

- How to configure a GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) that uses a matrix strategy to run on both `self-ubuntu-24.04` and `karolina`.
- How to pull, inspect, and run the Apptainer image on these environments.
- How to trigger the deploy workflow automatically from another job (e.g., when the Apptainer image is pushed).
- How to monitor and run parallel jobs in HPC using Apptainer and MPI.

== The Deploy Workflow

Below is the complete `deploy.yml` file used to deploy the Apptainer image:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Deploy                                     # <1>

on:
  workflow_dispatch:                               # <2>

jobs:
  deploy:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        runs-on: [self-ubuntu-24.04, karolina]     # <3>
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runs-on }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository                # <4>
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create sif filename                # <5>
        run: |
          sif=$(basename "${{ github.repository }}.sif")
          echo "SIF_FILENAME=$sif" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Set APPTAINER_CMD                   # <6>
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.runs-on }}" == "karolina" ]; then
            apptainer_cmd=apptainer
          else 
            apptainer_cmd=/opt/apptainer/v1.4.0/apptainer/bin/apptainer
          fi  
          echo "Using apptainer command: $apptainer_cmd"
          echo "APPTAINER_CMD=$apptainer_cmd" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: PULL Apptainer SIF                # <7>
        run: |
          # Pull the SIF file from GHCR
          $APPTAINER_CMD pull -F $SIF_FILENAME oras://ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:solution-sif
          # Inspect the SIF file to verify its contents
          $APPTAINER_CMD inspect $SIF_FILENAME

      - name: Run Container on self-ubuntu-24.04  # <8>
        if: matrix.runs-on == 'self-ubuntu-24.04'
        run: |
          # Run the containerized application using mpirun
          mpirun -np 4 $APPTAINER_CMD run $SIF_FILENAME myapp

      - name: Run Container on Karolina           # <9>
        if: matrix.runs-on == 'karolina'
        run: |
          # Use a helper script (job_monitor.sh) to submit and monitor the job on Karolina
          bash job_monitor.sh $SIF_FILENAME
----
<1> **Workflow Name:** A descriptive title for the deploy workflow.
<2> **Manual Trigger:** The workflow is triggered manually via Workflow Dispatch.
<3> **Matrix Strategy:** The job runs on two environments: `self-ubuntu-24.04` and `karolina`.
<4> **Checkout Step:** Clones your repository into the workflow environment.
<5> **Create SIF Filename:** Generates the SIF filename based on the repository name and saves it to the environment.
<6> **Set Apptainer Command:** Determines which Apptainer command to use based on the environment (using a module on Karolina or a local path on self‑ubuntu‑24.04) and saves it.
<7> **Pull and Inspect SIF:** Pulls the Apptainer SIF from GHCR and inspects it to verify the conversion.
<8> **Run on Self-Ubuntu:** Uses `mpirun` to execute the application inside the container on the self‑ubuntu‑24.04 runner.
<9> **Run on Karolina:** Invokes a helper script (`job_monitor.sh`) to submit and monitor the job on Karolina.

== Triggering the Deploy Workflow Automatically

To streamline the workflow, you can add a step in your `build_apptainer` job to trigger the deploy workflow as soon as the Apptainer image is pushed. For example, in your `build_apptainer` job add the step below at the end:

[source,shell]
----
    - name: Trigger Deployment                # <10>
        run: |
          # This step triggers the deploy workflow automatically.
          # It can be invoked from the build_apptainer job after a successful image push.
          gh workflow run deploy.yml
----
This command triggers the `deploy.yml` workflow on the `solution` branch, ensuring that both the `self-ubuntu-24.04` and `karolina` jobs are executed.

== Conclusion

This hands‑on session has demonstrated:

- How to set up a GitHub Actions deploy workflow using a matrix to target different environments.
- How to pull, inspect, and run an Apptainer SIF image on both a local runner and an HPC system.
- How to automatically trigger the deploy workflow from another job.
