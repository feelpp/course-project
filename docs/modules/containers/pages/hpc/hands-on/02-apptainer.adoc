== Connecting to Karolina HPC and Using Apptainer

Because Apptainer does not run within a Docker Codespace, you'll need to connect to the Karolina HPC system (EuroHPC) to work with Apptainer. 
In this section, we'll cover:

- How to SSH into Karolina.
- How to remotely log in to GHCR.
- How to pull, inspect, and run your Apptainer (SIF) image.
- How to bind host directories and launch an interactive shell.

=== Connecting to Karolina HPC

First, connect to the Karolina HPC system. Replace `your_username` and adjust the hostname as needed:

[source,shell]
----
ssh your_username@login1.karolina.it4i.cz
----

=== Remote Login to GitHub Container Registry

Before pulling your image, you need to log in to GHCR using Apptainerâ€™s remote login command. 
Replace `<username>` and `<GHCR_PAT>` with your GitHub username and Personal Access Token respectively:

[source,shell]
----
apptainer remote login -u <username> -p <GHCR_PAT> oras://ghcr.io
----

=== Pulling and Inspecting the Docker Package as a SIF Image

Pull the Docker image (from GHCR) and convert it to an Apptainer SIF file:

[source,shell]
----
apptainer pull -F myapp.sif docker://ghcr.io/<username>/myapp:latest
----

After pulling, inspect the SIF image to verify its contents:

[source,shell]
----
apptainer inspect myapp.sif
----

=== Running the Apptainer Container

You can run your container in several ways on Karolina:

* **Interactive Mode (Shell):**

[source,shell]
----
apptainer shell myapp.sif
----

* **Default Command:**

[source,shell]
----
apptainer run myapp.sif
----

* **MPI Batch Execution:**

[source,shell]
----
mpirun -np 4 apptainer exec myapp.sif ./my_mpi_app
----

=== Mounting Directories and Using an Interactive Shell

Often in HPC, you need to access data stored on the host. 
Use the `--bind` option to mount directories into your container. 
For example, to mount `/data` from the host to `/mnt/data` inside the container and then launch a Bash shell:

[source,shell]
----
apptainer exec --bind /data:/mnt/data myapp.sif /bin/bash
----

This command allows you to interact with your data within the container environment.

== Conclusion

In this section, you learned how to:
- Connect to the Karolina HPC system via SSH.
- Remotely log in to GHCR to retrieve your Docker-based Apptainer image.
- Pull, inspect, and run your Apptainer SIF image.
- Bind host directories and launch an interactive shell within the container.

These steps ensure that your HPC applications run in a reproducible, containerized environment on Karolina HPC.
