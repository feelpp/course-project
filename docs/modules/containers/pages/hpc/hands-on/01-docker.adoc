A 30-minute hands-on session to introduce Docker fundamentals with a focus on HPC development.

== Overview

In this session, you will learn:

- The basic components of the Docker system.
- How to run containers interactively and in detached mode.
- Key Docker commands such as `docker ps`, `docker images`, and how to manage container lifecycles.
- How Docker concepts translate to HPC containerization workflows.

== Docker System Components

image:docker/basics-of-docker-system.png[title="Basics of Docker System", link="https://www.docker.com/"]

The basic components of the Docker system are:

- **Images**: Blueprints of the application and its dependencies.
- **Containers**: Running instances of images.
- **Volumes**: Persistent data storage.
- **Networks**: Isolated environments for containers to communicate.
- **Dockerfile**: A file used to create Docker images.

== Docker Hello World Example

Let's start by running a simple Docker container:

[source,shell]
----
docker run hello-world
----

This command pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container. Notice that the container runs, prints a message, and then exits.

== Running Ubuntu in a Container

You can start an interactive session in an Ubuntu container. In this example, we also use the `--rm` flag.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash
----

* **Explanation:**
  - `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after it exits, keeping your system clean.
  - `-it`: Combines `-i` (interactive) and `-t` (allocate a pseudo-TTY) to enable an interactive shell session.
  
After running this command, you'll have an interactive Bash shell inside the Ubuntu container.

== Essential Docker Commands

=== Listing Containers and Images

* **`docker ps`**  
  Lists all running containers.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker ps
----
  
* **`docker ps -a`**  
  Lists all containers, including those that have exited.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker ps -a
----
  
* **`docker images`**  
  Lists all available Docker images on your system.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker images
----

=== Running Containers in Detached Mode

To run a container in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -d ubuntu sleep 60
----
* **Explanation:**  
  - `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
  - In this example, the container will run the `sleep 60` command and exit after 60 seconds.  
  - The `--rm` flag ensures the container is removed automatically when it stops.

=== Logging into and Out of Docker Registries

==== Creating a GHCR_PAT (Classic Token) for GitHub Container Registry

To authenticate with GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io), you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the proper scopes. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to GitHub Settings:**  
   Click your profile icon in the upper-right corner and select **Settings**.

2. **Navigate to Developer Settings:**  
   In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.

3. **Personal Access Tokens:**  
   Click **Personal access tokens** and then select **Generate new token (classic)**.

4. **Configure Your Token:**  
   - **Note:** Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "GHCR PAT for Actions").  
   - **Expiration:** Set an expiration date appropriate for your use case.  
   - **Scopes:** Make sure to select at least the following:
     - `read:packages` – Required to pull packages from GHCR.
     - `write:packages` – Required to push packages to GHCR.
     - *(Optional)* `delete:packages` – If you need to remove packages.
  
5. **Generate the Token:**  
   Click **Generate token** at the bottom of the page.

6. **Copy the Token:**  
   **Important:** Copy the generated token immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

7. **Use the Token:**  
   Save this token as `GHCR_PAT` in your GitHub repository secrets for use in your CI/CD workflows.

For more details, refer to the GitHub documentation on [creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

==== Login and Logout Commands

* **`docker login`**  
  Log into a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).

[source,shell]
----
docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password $GHCR_PAT
----
* Replace `<your-username>` with your actual username and supply your password via standard input (or use a secret in CI/CD pipelines).

* **`docker logout`**  
  Log out from the Docker registry.

[source,shell]
----
docker logout ghcr.io
----
  
== Advanced Docker Usage

=== Volumes: Persistent Storage

Use volumes to store data that persists even after a container is removed. 
For example, run an Ubuntu container with a mounted volume from your local `/tmp` directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it -v /tmp:/tmp ubuntu bash
----
Inside the container, you can run `df` to view the mounted volume.

=== Docker Images and Updates

Docker images can be updated and modified by creating new image layers. 

This approach allows you to:

- **Roll Back Updates:** Easily revert to a previous image version.
- **Efficient Testing:** Only new layers need to be pushed or pulled.
- **Optimized Distribution:** Minimize changes, reducing download times.

== Docker for HPC

Docker serves as a foundational tool in HPC container workflows:

- **Development & Testing:** Create and test HPC applications in a controlled Docker environment.
- **Container Conversion:** Docker images can be converted to Apptainer/Singularity images for deployment on HPC clusters.
- **Reproducibility:** Docker ensures consistent environments across different stages of development and production.

- Running containers interactively and in detached mode.
- Managing containers and images with `docker ps` and `docker images`.
- Logging into and out of Docker registries.
