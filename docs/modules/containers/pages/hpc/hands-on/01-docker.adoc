A 30-minute hands-on session to introduce Docker fundamentals with a focus on HPC development.

== Overview

In this session, you will learn:

- The basic components of the Docker system.
- How to run containers interactively and in detached mode.
- Key Docker commands such as `docker ps`, `docker images`, and how to manage container lifecycles.
- How Docker concepts translate to HPC containerization workflows.

== Docker System Components

The basic components of the Docker system are:

- **Images**: Blueprints of the application and its dependencies.
- **Containers**: Running instances of images.
- **Volumes**: Persistent data storage.
- **Networks**: Isolated environments for containers to communicate.
- **Dockerfile**: A file used to create Docker images.

== Docker Hello World Example

Let's start by running a simple Docker container:

[source,shell]
----
docker run hello-world
----

This command pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container. Notice that the container runs, prints a message, and then exits.

== Running Ubuntu in a Container

You can start an interactive session in an Ubuntu container. In this example, we also use the `--rm` flag.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash
----

* **Explanation:**
  - `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after it exits, keeping your system clean.
  - `-it`: Combines `-i` (interactive) and `-t` (allocate a pseudo-TTY) to enable an interactive shell session.
  
After running this command, you'll have an interactive Bash shell inside the Ubuntu container.

== Essential Docker Commands

=== Listing Containers and Images

* **`docker ps`**  
  Lists all running containers.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker ps
----
  
* **`docker ps -a`**  
  Lists all containers, including those that have exited.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker ps -a
----
  
* **`docker images`**  
  Lists all available Docker images on your system.
  
[source,shell]
----
docker images
----

=== Running Containers in Detached Mode

To run a container in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -d ubuntu sleep 60
----
* **Explanation:**  
  - `-d` runs the container in detached mode.
  - In this example, the container will run the `sleep 60` command and exit after 60 seconds.  
  - The `--rm` flag ensures the container is removed automatically when it stops.

=== Logging into and Out of Docker Registries

* **`docker login`**  
  Log into a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry).

[source,shell]
----
docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password-stdin
----
* Replace `<your-username>` with your actual username and supply your password via standard input (or use a secret in CI/CD pipelines).

* **`docker logout`**  
  Log out from the Docker registry.

[source,shell]
----
docker logout ghcr.io
----
  
== Advanced Docker Usage

=== Volumes: Persistent Storage

Use volumes to store data that persists even after a container is removed. 
For example, run an Ubuntu container with a mounted volume from your local `/tmp` directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -it -v /tmp:/tmp ubuntu bash
----
Inside the container, you can run `df` to view the mounted volume.

=== Docker Images and Updates

Docker images can be updated and modified by creating new image layers. 

This approach allows you to:

- **Roll Back Updates:** Easily revert to a previous image version.
- **Efficient Testing:** Only new layers need to be pushed or pulled.
- **Optimized Distribution:** Minimize changes, reducing download times.

== Docker for HPC

Docker serves as a foundational tool in HPC container workflows:

- **Development & Testing:** Create and test HPC applications in a controlled Docker environment.
- **Container Conversion:** Docker images can be converted to Apptainer/Singularity images for deployment on HPC clusters.
- **Reproducibility:** Docker ensures consistent environments across different stages of development and production.

== Conclusion

We covered:

- Basic Docker components and commands.
- Running containers interactively and in detached mode.
- Managing containers and images with `docker ps` and `docker images`.
- Logging into and out of Docker registries.
- Advanced topics including volumes and image layering.
- How Docker basics underpin HPC containerization workflows.
