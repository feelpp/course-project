== Best Practices and Performance Considerations (10 min)

=== Optimizing Container Images
* **Keep images small and lean:**  
  - Use minimal base images.
  - Remove unnecessary packages and files after installation.
* **Pin package versions:**  
  - Specify exact versions for all dependencies to ensure consistency.
* **Separate build and runtime stages:**  
  - Utilize multi-stage builds to compile code in one stage and run it in another, reducing final image size.

=== Performance Considerations
* **Minimize container startup overhead:**  
  - Optimize entrypoint scripts and image initialization.
* **Efficient GPU and MPI integration:**  
  - Ensure that GPU drivers, MPI libraries, and other performance-critical components are correctly mounted and compatible.
* **Adapt for HPC workloads:**  
  - Recognize that HPC jobs are typically long-running, bulk-synchronous operations rather than short-lived microservices. Adjust design and tuning accordingly.

=== Security & DevOps in HPC
* **Avoid root access in containers:**  
  - Run containers as non-root users to enhance security.
* **Integrate with resource managers:**  
  - Ensure container workflows work seamlessly with HPC schedulers (e.g., Slurm, PBS).
* **Leverage version control and registries:**  
  - Use Git-based version control and container registries to maintain reproducible images.
* **DevOps Workflow:**  
  - Develop locally with Docker, then import containers into HPC clusters (e.g., using Apptainer) for production deployments.

=== General HPC Container Gotchas
* Containers run as the user, not root.
* Images are typically mounted read-only.  
  - However, directories such as Home, Scratch, or Lustre are usually available.
* Some volume mount locations may be disallowed.
* Volumes currently cannot be mounted over each other.

=== Best Practices

* **Automate the Build Process:**  
  - Build container images using scripts rather than manually entering commands to ensure repeatability and reduce human error.

* **Use Trusted Base Images:**  
  - Start from reliable, well-maintained images.  
  - For instance, if you need to build from source:
+
[source,Dockerfile]
----
RUN git clone https://github.com/foo/bar.git
RUN cd bar && git checkout 4e3c9cc && make install
----

* **Order Matters â€“ Leverage the Build Cache:**  
  - Organize your Dockerfile instructions to maximize caching and speed up iterative builds.

* **Multi-Stage Builds (Available since Docker 17.05):**  
  - Use multi-stage builds to separate the build environment from the runtime environment, keeping images small and secure.  
  Example:
+
[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM centos:7 as build
RUN yum -y install gcc make
ADD code.c /src/code.c
RUN gcc -o /src/mycode /src/code.c

FROM centos:7 as run
COPY --from=build /src/mycode /usr/bin/mycode
----

=== Other Considerations
* **Image Size:**  
  - Avoid very large images (typically >~5GB) to facilitate easier distribution and faster deployment.
* **Data Management:**  
  - Keep large application data in shared directories (Home, Scratch, Lustre) and mount them into the container rather than embedding them.
* **Rapid Prototyping:**  
  - Use volume mounts for rapid prototyping and testing. Once the code stabilizes, consider incorporating these dependencies directly into the image.
