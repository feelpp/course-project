**Why Containers for Mathematics?**

Mathematical research increasingly requires:
- **Reproducible Computations**: Ensure your numerical results can be replicated by others
- **Complex Software Stacks**: Manage dependencies for mathematical libraries (NumPy, SciPy, MATLAB, Mathematica)
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Share mathematical code that works on different operating systems
- **Collaboration**: Provide colleagues with identical computing environments
- **Long-term Preservation**: Archive computational environments for future reference

Containers solve the "it works on my machine" problem that plagues mathematical computing.

Containers provide lightweight, portable, and consistent environments for mathematical applications. They package mathematical software with all dependencies, ensuring computations run identically across development, testing, and production environments.

For mathematics students, containers are essential for **reproducible research**, **collaborative mathematical computing**, and **sharing numerical experiments**. They enable you to capture your entire mathematical computing environment and share it with advisors, collaborators, or reviewers.

== Mathematical Applications of Containers

**Real Use Cases for Mathematics Students:**

Numerical Analysis Projects::
Package Python/MATLAB environments with specific library versions for consistent numerical results

Statistical Computing::
Create reproducible R or Python environments for data analysis and visualization

Mathematical Software Distribution::
Share custom mathematical algorithms with guaranteed dependencies

Computational Research::
Archive complete computational environments with published mathematical papers

High-Performance Computing::
Deploy mathematical software consistently across different HPC clusters

In this module, we will explore Docker, Apptainer (formerly Singularity), and other container technologies.
