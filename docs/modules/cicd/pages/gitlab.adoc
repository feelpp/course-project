== Review of CI/CD as a concept

CI (Continuous Integration)::
  ** Is your code good?
  ** earlier you run tests, sooner you find problems
  ** makes sure that any file edits made integrate well with the stable code base
    *** functional tests
    *** security scans
    *** code quality scans
    *** performance tests
    *** license scanning
    *** fuzz testing
  ** gives everyone on the team an understanding of the state of the
    software

CD (Continuous Delivery / Continous Deployment)::
  ** more ambiguous
  ** finding out where your code should go
    *** and putting it there
  ** make releases "boring"

  ** different environments
    *** testing/development environments (run against feature branches etc)
    *** staging/pre-prodcution (run against main)
    *** production envs (run against tags)

  ** continuous delivery
    *** automatic deploy to test and dev envs
    *** not automatically deployed to production without manual approval
  ** continuous deployment
    *** deploy to production automatically

  ** building/packaging
    *** preparing the code into deployable form
      **** ruby gem
      **** java war/ear
      **** c code -> docker image
      **** tarball
      **** no packaging/building

  ** sending/delivering/deploying
    *** pushing docker image to repository
    *** using a cli tool to deploy to AWS environment
    *** last (sometimes only) task of CD

CI/CD Pipeline can be tool agnostic::
  ** pipelines ultimately boil down to a series of shell commands
    *** that run automatically
    *** i.e. series of tasks run by a robot that relate to
      **** building
      **** verifying
      **** deploying

== Overview of Gitlab CI

A Gitlab CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps::
  ** performed on your files
  ** when ever you commit and push source code changes
  ** blueprint/recipe
    
Steps::
  ** tasks that are performed on your files
    *** tests
    *** security scans
    *** build / packaging
      **** zip file?
      **** linux package?
      **** docker container?
    *** deploy / set up
      **** test env
      **** prod env
  ** inspect, test, package, deploy, any manpipulation of files

Runners::
  ** Runners are robots/daemons/programs that
    *** take these steps from somewhere (e.g. Github/Gitlab instance)
    *** and execute them in an environment
    *** where the rubber meets the road
      **** CI/CD code to actual tasks

Parts of a pieline::
  ** Stages
    *** One or more
    *** help readibility/maintainibility of pipeline
    *** collection of pipeline tasks that are related
      **** build
        ***** compile
        **** package?
      **** test
        ***** linting
        ***** unit tests
        ***** scans
      **** deploy
        ***** package
        ***** deliver
     **** each stage is executed sequentially by default
       ***** one stage after another
       ***** can be changed using the needs keyword

  ** Jobs
    *** equivilant to steps/tasks
    *** Each stage contains one more more jobs
    *** best practice to have each job do one task
    *** all jobs within a stage are executed in parallel by default
      **** can be changed using the needs keyword

  ** Commands
    *** each job contains one or more commands
    *** job is the robot/runner take types commands in to a bash shell
      **** javac *.java
      **** docker build --tag my_app:1.2
      **** mvn test
    *** in the end, running all of the commands of a pipeline manually
    *** is the same thing as running the pipeline through a runner
       
Running Pipelines::
  ** automatically
    *** commit push
    *** merge request
      **** source code of branch of merge request
    *** merged result
      **** pipeline on a temporary merge
    *** merge train
      **** sepearte, concurrent merged result piepeline
      **** temp merge of source branches from every merge request that's ahead of the current merge request in the queue.
  ** manually
    *** branch
    *** tag
    *** skipping pipelines    

  ** certain "features" of the single pipeline can be turned on or off,
    *** depending on which features make sesnse for the type of changes.
    *** unit tests on code changes
    *** spelling/editing tests on documentation changes

== Karlina and IT4I's CI/CD setup

Documentation::
  ** https://docs.it4i.cz/general/tools/cicd/#execution-of-ci-pipelines-in-docker-containers

Gitlab Instance::
  ** code.it4i.cz
    *** you should have an account.

Gitlab Runners::
  ** 7 System Runners
  ** 5 Docker Runners

Jacamar CI::
  ** System Runners use a custom executor model called Jacamar CI 
  ** handles authorisation and downscoping, matching hpc username to Gitlab username
  ** interacts directly with SLURM/PBS schedulers
  ** documentation:
    *** https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/docs/admin/jacamar/introduction.html

      
== A comparison of Gitlab CI and Github Actions

Similarities::

* both systems base their workflow language on YAML
* both systems support multiple stages, and work directly on your files in the associated repo.

Differences::

* Gitlab CI does not have a comparable marketplace like Github Actions.
  ** new feature/component under development, available: "Gitlab Steps"
    *** https://docs.gitlab.com/17.9/ci/steps/
    *** official components developed by Gitlab (safe but not so many)
    *** support now added to use Github Actions in Gitlab CI. Weird!
      
* Gitlab has support for custom executers
  ** JacamarCI
  ** a native Kubernetes executer.

* only one pipeline workflow file per project
  * .gitlab-ci.yml

=== What is a Github Action?

* a container image, in principle.
* either has an action.yml that calls javascript code.
* or a Dockerfile that can call anything (python, c, etc)

== Gitlab YAML syntax

documentation::
  * https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/migration/github_actions/#github-actions-workflow-syntax
  * https://docs.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/manually-migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-gitlab-cicd-to-github-actions

* upload-artifact and download-artifact replaced with "artifcats"

* secrets management
  ** github has integrated secrets management
  ** gitlab encourages 3rd party tools (like Vault)
    ** or have to use masked and protected ci/cd variables
