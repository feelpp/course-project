== Review of CI/CD as a concept

CI (Continuous Integration)::
* Is your code good?
* earlier you run tests, sooner you find problems
* makes sure that any file edits made integrate well with the stable code base
** functional tests
** security scans
** code quality scans
** performance tests
** license scanning
** fuzz testing
* gives everyone on the team an understanding of the state of thesoftware

CD (Continuous Delivery / Continous Deployment)::
* more ambiguous
* finding out where your code should go
** and putting it there
* make releases "boring"

* different environments
** testing/development environments (run against feature branches etc)
** staging/pre-prodcution (run against main)
** production envs (run against tags)

* continuous delivery#
** automatic deploy to test and dev envs
** not automatically deployed to production without manual approval
* continuous deployment
** deploy to production automatically

* building/packaging
** preparing the code into deployable form
*** ruby gem
*** java war/ear
*** c code -> docker image
*** tarball
*** no packaging/building

* sending/delivering/deploying
** pushing docker image to repository
** using a cli tool to deploy to AWS environment
** last (sometimes only) task of CD

CI/CD Pipeline can be tool agnostic::
* pipelines ultimately boil down to a series of shell commands
** that run automatically
** i.e. series of tasks run by a robot that relate to
*** building
*** verifying
*** deploying

== Overview of Gitlab CI

.GitLab CI Diagram

The three major parts of a Gitlab CI/CD pipeline::
* the Gitlab instance
* The Gitlab CI Workflow file
* Gitlab Runner(s)

The Gitlab CI Workflow file::
* is a series of steps performed on your files
* when ever you commit and push source code changes
* can be thought of as a blueprint/recipe

Steps::
* tasks that are performed on your files
** tests
** security scans
** build / packaging
*** zip file?
*** linux package?
*** docker container?
** deploy / set up
*** test env
*** prod env
* basically, steps are any manipulation of your repository files

Runners::
* Runners are robots/daemons/programs that
** take these steps from somewhere (e.g. Github/Gitlab instance)
** and execute them in an environment
** where the rubber meets the road
*** CI/CD code to actual tasks

* GitLab Runners are open source programs
** written in Go
** https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner
** can be self-hosted (installed on your own infrastructure)
** or used through 3rd party installations (e.g. Gitlab.com runners)
** Each Runner Agent can spawn multiple runner processes.

* Runners can be private or shared
** specifically registered to a single repository
** Or shared with a project/organisation
** Or belong to an entire GitLab instance

* Runners have different "executors"
** This allows them to perform or execute your steps
** In different environments.
*** Shell
*** Docker
*** Virtual Machines
*** Kubernetes
*** Custom

.Anatomy of a Pipeline Workflow
image::../images/Gitlab_CI-Page-2.drawio.png[Workflow_File]



Parts of a pipeline::
* Stages
** One or more
** help readibility/maintainibility of pipeline
** collection of pipeline tasks that are related
*** build
**** compile
*** package?
*** test
**** linting
**** unit tests
**** scans
*** deploy
**** package
**** deliver
*** each stage is executed sequentially by default
**** one stage after another
**** can be changed using the needs keyword

* Jobs
** equivilant to steps/tasks
** Each stage contains one more more jobs
** best practice to have each job do one task
** all jobs within a stage are executed in parallel by default
*** can be changed using the needs keyword

* Commands
** each job contains one or more commands
** job is the robot/runner take types commands in to a bash shell
*** javac *.java
*** docker build --tag my_app:1.2
*** mvn test
** in the end, running all of the commands of a pipeline manually
** is the same thing as running the pipeline through a runner
  
Running Pipelines::
* automatically
** commit push
** merge request
*** source code of branch of merge request
** merged result
*** pipeline on a temporary merge
** merge train
*** sepearte, concurrent merged result piepeline
*** temp merge of source branches from every merge request that's ahead of the current merge request in the queue.
* manually
** branch
** tag
** skipping pipelines    

* certain "features" of the single pipeline can be turned on or off,
** depending on which features make sesnse for the type of changes.
** unit tests on code changes
** spelling/editing tests on documentation changes

== Karlina and IT4I's CI/CD setup

Documentation::
* https://docs.it4i.cz/general/tools/cicd/#cicd

Gitlab Instance::
* https://code.it4i.cz
** If you have been granted access to Karolina or other IT4I systems, you should have an account here.

Gitlab Runners::
* 7 System Runners
** 4 runners (of this type) running in the login nodes of Karolina,
** 2 runners (of this type) running in the login nodes of Barbora,
** 1 runner (of this type) running in the login node of Complementary systems.

* 5 Docker Runners

* We are not able to choose exactly which of the GitLab runners will be picked.
** We use tags to select which cluster we want the CI job to be submitted to as a SLURM job.
** One of the GitLab runners that match our CI job's tags(running in the login node of the specified cluster) will automatically pick our  job.

Jacamar CI::
* System Runners use a custom executor model called Jacamar CI 
* handles authorisation and downscoping, matching hpc username to Gitlab username
* interacts directly with SLURM/PBS schedulers
* documentation:
** https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/docs/admin/jacamar/introduction.html

 
== A comparison of Gitlab CI and Github Actions

Similarities::

* both systems base their workflow language on YAML
* both systems support multiple stages, and work directly on your files in the associated repo.

Differences::

* Gitlab CI does not have a comparable marketplace like Github Actions.
** new feature/component under development, available: "Gitlab Steps"
*** https://docs.gitlab.com/17.9/ci/steps/
*** official components developed by Gitlab (safe but not so many)
*** support now added to use Github Actions in Gitlab CI. Weird!
 
* Gitlab has support for custom executers
** JacamarCI
** a native Kubernetes executer.

* only one pipeline workflow file per project
* .gitlab-ci.yml

=== What is a Github Action?

* A Github action can be thought of as a simple program, or more like a Function As A Service.
* It consists of
** an action.yml that describes inputs and what program the action calls.
** Either a docker file to make a container based action. This can run anything from shell scripts to python code.
* Or a Nodejs application, usually calling index.html as the starting point.


== Gitlab YAML syntax

* https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/migration/github_actions/#github-actions-workflow-syntax
* https://docs.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/manually-migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-gitlab-cicd-to-github-actions

** gitlab encourages 3rd party tools (like Vault)
** or have to use masked and protected ci/cd variables
