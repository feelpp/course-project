Ready to begin? This guide gets you started in the Course Project based on your mathematical background and computational experience.

== 🚀 **In 5 Minutes: Find Your Starting Point**

[.steps]
=== Step 1: Take the Assessment
Navigate to xref:prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites & Self-Assessment] and complete the quick skills checklist (2 minutes).

=== Step 2: Choose Your Track
Based on your assessment results:

🟢 **Beginner Track** (0-3 checkboxes)::
Start with xref:linux:index.adoc[Linux Essentials for Mathematics Students]

🟡 **Intermediate Track** (4-7 checkboxes)::  
Jump to xref:project-management:index.adoc[Project Management for Research]

🔴 **Advanced Track** (8+ checkboxes)::
Begin with xref:containers:index.adoc[Containers for Mathematical Computing]

=== Step 3: Set Up Your Environment
Follow the setup instructions in your chosen starting module.

=== Step 4: Join the Community
Connect with other students on https://join.slack.com/t/feelpp/shared_invite/zt-2qe0q9hw-4pVbhohCXUE6Po9Ma8dbiQ[Slack] for questions and collaboration.

== 📖 **For Instructors: Teaching This Course**

**New to teaching computational tools to mathematics students?**

1. **Review the Instructor Guide**: Start with xref:instructor-guide.adoc[📚 Instructor Guide] for comprehensive teaching strategies
2. **Understand Your Students**: Most CSMI students are mathematicians, not computer scientists
3. **Emphasize Mathematical Relevance**: Always connect tools to mathematical research applications
4. **Plan for Mixed Skill Levels**: Use the 3-track system to accommodate different backgrounds

**Key Success Factors:**
- Begin with mathematical motivation for each tool
- Provide plenty of hands-on practice with mathematical examples  
- Support struggling students with peer mentoring
- Connect tools to real mathematical research workflows

== 🎯 **Learning Objectives by Track**

=== 🟢 **Foundational Track Goals**
By completion, students will:

- Navigate Linux systems confidently for mathematical computing
- Use Git to manage LaTeX documents and research code
- Set up VS Code for mathematical work
- Apply basic project management to research projects

=== 🟡 **Intermediate Track Goals**  
By completion, students will:

- Collaborate effectively on mathematical research projects
- Create reproducible computational environments
- Manage complex research projects with multiple collaborators
- Understand automation basics for mathematical workflows

=== 🔴 **Advanced Track Goals**
By completion, students will:

- Deploy mathematical software on HPC systems
- Implement sophisticated automation for mathematical research
- Create production-quality mathematical software workflows
- Lead computational mathematics projects

== 🛠️ **Technical Requirements**

=== All Students Need:

- Computer with administrative privileges
- Internet connection for downloads
- 20GB free disk space
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

=== Additional for Advanced Track:

- Access to Linux system (native, VM, or WSL)
- 8GB+ RAM for container work
- Basic familiarity with command line

== ❓ **Common Questions**

**"I'm a pure mathematician - do I really need these tools?"**::
Modern mathematics increasingly involves computation, collaboration, and data analysis. These tools will make your research more efficient and reproducible, whether you're working on theoretical proofs or applied problems.

**"What if I get stuck or fall behind?"**::
+
- Use the Slack community for peer support
- Attend instructor office hours  
- Form study groups with other mathematics students
- Remember: you can always go back to review earlier concepts

**"How much time should I expect to spend?"**::
+
- **Foundational Track**: 4-6 hours per week for 6-8 weeks
- **Intermediate Track**: 3-4 hours per week for 4-6 weeks  
- **Advanced Track**: 2-3 hours per week for 3-4 weeks

**"Can I switch tracks if I chose wrong?"**::
Absolutely! The tracks are flexible. If you find content too easy or challenging, you can adjust your path at any time.
