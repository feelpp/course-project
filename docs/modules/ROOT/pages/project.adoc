== What is a Project?

[.slide]
=== Definition of a Project

* Sequence of tasks
** Planned from beginning to end
** Bounded by time, resources, & required results
* Defined outcome and "deliverables"
* Deadline
* Budget
** Limits number of people, supplies, and capital

NOTE: This definition emphasizes that a project is a structured effort with specific limitations and goals. It's essential to clearly outline these elements at the start of a project.

[.slide]
=== Tasks vs Projects

- Responding to email
- Making coffee
- Writing a letter to a prospect
- Hooking up a printer
- Producing a customer newsletter
- Catering a party
- Writing a book
- Implementing a computer network

NOTE: This slide distinguishes between routine tasks and projects, highlighting the complexity and structured nature of projects.

[.slide]
=== Five Features of a Project

* Defined beginning, end, schedule, and approach
* Use resources specifically allocated to the work
* End results have specific goals (time, cost, performance/quality)
* Follows planned, organized approach
* Usually involves a team of people

NOTE: A well-defined project has these five key features, which are crucial for its successful completion.

[.slide]
=== Resources (and Constraints)

- Time
- People
- Money
- Equipment
- Facilities

NOTE: Effective project management requires understanding and managing these resources and constraints.

[.slide]
=== What Makes a Project Successful?

* Organized, well-planned approach
* Project Team Commitment
* Balance among
** Time
** Resources
** Results
** Customer Satisfaction

NOTE: Balancing these factors is key to the success of any project.

[.slide]
=== What is a program?

- A recurring project
- Happens predictably
- New plan
- New end result
- New set of resources

NOTE: Understanding the distinction between a project and a program is vital for project managers.

[.slide]
=== Review of Project Elements

* Well-defined goal
* Expectation of time commitment
* Underlying costs to achieve
* Described plan of achievement
* Listing of goalâ€™s major sub-elements
* Description of risks or unknown factors
* Success measurement techniques

NOTE: This comprehensive list helps in understanding all aspects involved in a project.

[.slide]
=== Phases of a Project

* Conceptualization
* Feasibility
* Preliminary planning
* Detailed planning
* Execution
* Testing
* Termination

NOTE: Familiarity with these phases helps in navigating through the lifecycle of a project.

[.slide]
=== Phase 1: Initiating

- Recognize the project should be done
- Determine what the project should accomplish
- Define the overall project goal
- Define general expectations of customers, management, or other stakeholders as appropriate
- Define the general project scope
- Select initial members of the project team

NOTE: The initiation phase is crucial for setting the direction of the project.

[.slide]
=== Phase 2: Planning

- Refining the project scope
- Listing tasks and activities
- Optimally sequencing activities
- Developing a working schedule and budget for assigning resources
- Getting the plan approved by stakeholders

NOTE: Planning is where the project's feasibility and methodology are firmly established.

[.slide]
=== Phase 3 - Executing

- Leading the team
- Meeting with team members
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Fire-fighting to resolve problems
- Securing necessary resources to complete the project plan

NOTE: Execution is the phase where plans are put into action and monitored for progress.

[.slide]
=== Phase 4 - Controlling

- Monitoring deviation from the plan
- Taking corrective action to match actual progress with the plan
- Receiving and evaluating project changes requested
- Rescheduling the project as necessary
- Adapting resource levels as necessary
- Changing the project scope
- Returning to the planning stage

NOTE: Control mechanisms are vital for keeping the project on track.

[.slide]
=== Phase 5 - Closing

- Acknowledging achievement and results
- Shutting down the operations and disbanding the team
- Learning from the project experience
- Reviewing the project process and outcomes
- Writing a final project report

NOTE: The closing phase is critical for assessing the project and learning for future projects.

[.slide]
=== Gantt Diagram

Gantt Diagram represents the projects in a table with

- Tasks/Milestones/Groups as rows
- Time(Days, Weeks, Months) as columns

A task may span over several days, weeks, months

NOTE: Gantt charts are essential tools for visualizing project timelines and dependencies.

== Software Project Management

[.slide]
=== Project management processes

- Lots of project management processes (see Wikipedia)
- Agile programming:
** project == relatively small tasks conceived and executed as the situation demands in an adaptive manner
** project != completely pre-planned process
- Extreme programming (similar to Agile)

NOTE: Agile and Extreme programming are modern methodologies focusing on adaptability and iterative development.
