- Emphasize mathematical relevance in every command

**Script for Encouragement:**
[source,text]
----
"Think of the command line like mathematical notation - it seems complex at first, but it's actually a precise, powerful language for expressing exactly what you want the computer to do. Just like mathematical notation, once you learn the basics, it becomes much more efficient than everyday language."
----

=== Challenge 2: Students Don't See Relevance to Mathematics

**Symptoms:**
- "Why can't I just use MATLAB/Mathematica?"
- Resistance to learning new tools
- Focus on immediate assignment completion over skill building

**Solutions:**
