== Mathematical Background Assumptions

This course assumes you have:

‚úÖ Mathematics Prerequisites::
+
- Undergraduate mathematics degree or equivalent
- Familiarity with mathematical notation and concepts
- Experience with mathematical problem-solving

‚úÖ Computational Mathematics (helpful but not required)::
+
- Basic understanding of numerical methods

== Getting Help

**If you're unsure about your starting point:**

1. **Try the Linux module first** - it will quickly show if you need more basic preparation
2. **Ask on Slack** - link to the course Slack workspace
3. **Consult with instructors** during office hours
4. **Form study groups** with other mathematics students

**For Mathematics Students New to Programming:**

Don't worry if programming concepts seem foreign at first. The course is designed to introduce computational tools gradually, with mathematical applications as examples. Focus on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing commands.
