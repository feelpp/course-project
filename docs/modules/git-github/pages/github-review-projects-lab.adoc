:description: Introduce GitHub collaboration with a practical 90-minute lab centered on Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Projects.

[.lead]
This intro lab is designed for M1 students who covered Linux and GitHub basics and are discovering structured team workflows. The goal is to build collaboration habits before moving to advanced CI/CD and project workflow topics.

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students can:

- Create and structure issues with labels, assignees, and milestones.
- Open a pull request linked to an issue and close it using commit keywords.
- Organize work using GitHub Projects (table + board views).
- Run a short triage workflow as a team.

== Prerequisites

- xref:github-start.adoc[GitHub Getting Started]
- xref:github-collaborations.adoc[GitHub Collaborations]
- Optional reference: xref:project-management:github.adoc[GitHub for Project Management]

== Class Setup

This session uses:

- 3 groups of 2 students
- 1 group of 3 students

Each group works on the same project in a separate repository:

- `m1-g1-project`
- `m1-g2-project`
- `m1-g3-project`
- `m1-g4-project`

== Project Proposal

Project title: `Reproducible Mini Weather Analysis`

Goal: Build a small reproducible weather analysis workflow from a one-year hourly CSV dataset and document how to run it locally and with Docker.

Primary dataset columns:

- `cloud_cover`
- `diffuse_radiation`
- `direct_radiation`
- `relative_humidity_2m`
- `surface_pressure`
- `temperature_2m`
- `time` (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
- `wind_direction_10m`
- `wind_speed_10m`

Dataset size and coverage:

- `8760` hourly records (one full year)
- Time range in this file: 2022-12-31 23:00 UTC to 2023-12-31 22:00 UTC

Suggested repository structure:

|-- README.md

== Starter Weather Dataset

Download the starter CSV from this page attachment:

- xref:attachment$weather_hourly.csv[weather_hourly.csv]

NOTE: The `time` column is in Unix milliseconds. Students should convert it to readable datetime to support time-based analysis and plots.

== CSV Column Reference

[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===
|Column |Unit |Description

|`cloud_cover`
|`%`
|Cloud coverage of the sky (`0` = clear sky, `100` = fully overcast).

|`diffuse_radiation`
|`W/m^2`
|Solar radiation scattered by the atmosphere and clouds (not direct beam).

|`direct_radiation`
|`W/m^2`
|Direct beam solar radiation reaching the surface.

|`relative_humidity_2m`
|`%`
|Relative humidity measured around 2 meters above ground.

|`surface_pressure`
|`hPa`
|Atmospheric pressure at the surface.

|`temperature_2m`
|`deg C`
|Air temperature measured around 2 meters above ground.

|`time`
|`ms since Unix epoch`
|Timestamp of the measurement, stored as Unix milliseconds.

|`wind_direction_10m`
|`deg`
|Wind direction at 10 meters (`0/360` = North, `90` = East, `180` = South, `270` = West).

|`wind_speed_10m`
|`km/h`
|Wind speed at 10 meters above ground.
|===

== What Students Have To Do

1. Create a project board named `M1 Team Board` with statuses `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`.
2. Create all mandatory issues from the issue list below.
3. Assign owners, labels, priorities, effort, and milestone `Sprint-1`.
4. Work with one branch per issue.
5. Open PRs using `Closes #issue_number` in the PR description.
6. Review teammate PRs before merge.
7. Keep project status updated while work progresses.
8. Submit links to board, issues, and merged PRs.

== Issue List (Create These First)

[cols="1,3,1,1,1,5",options="header"]
|===
|ID |Issue title |Label |Priority |Effort |Done when

|1
|Initialize repository skeleton
|chore
|P1
|S
|`README.md`, `src/`, `data/`, `results/`, and `.gitignore` are committed.

|2
|Add weather dataset and data description
|documentation
|P1
|S
|`data/weather_hourly.csv` and `data/README.md` describe all columns and units.

|3
|Implement weather summary script
|enhancement
|P1
|M
|`src/analyze_weather.py` computes min/max/mean for `temperature_2m`, mean for `relative_humidity_2m`, max for `wind_speed_10m`, and one monthly aggregate.

|4
|Add input argument and filtering options
|enhancement
|P2
|S
|Script supports `--input <file>` and time filters (`--start`, `--end`) for sub-period analysis.

|5
|Convert and validate timestamps
|bug
|P1
|M
|Script converts `time` from Unix milliseconds to datetime and handles invalid/missing timestamps safely.

|6
|Containerize analysis
|chore
|P1
|M
|`Dockerfile` builds and runs analysis successfully.

|7
|Document run instructions
|documentation
|P1
|S
|README includes local run, Docker run, and expected outputs.

|8
|Configure project board views and fields
|chore
|P1
|S
|Board has `Backlog` (table), `Current Sprint` (board), and `My Tasks` views with fields `Status`, `Priority`, `Effort`.

|9
|Optional: add basic GitHub Actions workflow
|enhancement
|P3
|M
|A workflow runs a basic check (for example script execution or lint).

|10
|Optional: add one weather trend plot
|enhancement
|P3
|M
|Analysis generates one figure in `results/` (for example daily or monthly `temperature_2m` trend) and documents it in README.

== Workload Rules by Group Size

- Groups of 2: complete issues `1-8`, plus at least one optional issue (`9` or `10`).
- Group of 3: complete issues `1-8`, plus both optional issues (`9` and `10`).
- Every student must author at least one merged PR and review at least one teammate PR.

== Lab Plan (90 minutes)

=== Part 0: Setup (10 min)

1. Create labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`.
2. Create milestone: `Sprint-1`.
3. Create project: `M1 Team Board`.
4. Add fields: `Status`, `Priority`, `Effort`.

=== Part 1: Backlog Creation and Assignment (20 min)

1. Create issues `1-10` from the list above.
2. Assign issues to team members.
3. Add all issues to `M1 Team Board`.
4. Set `Priority` and `Effort` for each issue.

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -b feat/weather-summary
$ git add src/analyze_weather.py
$ git commit -m "Add weather summary script. Closes #3"
$ git push origin feat/weather-summary
----

=== Part 2: Implementation and PRs (35 min)

1. Start with all `P1` issues.
2. Move active items to `In Progress`.
3. Open PRs linked to issues (`Closes #...`).
4. Review and merge teammate PRs.

=== Part 3: Project Views and Triage (15 min)

1. Ensure board has `Backlog`, `Current Sprint`, and `My Tasks`.
2. Verify merged PRs close linked issues.
3. Move completed items to `Done`.
4. Leave one triage comment on a blocked or pending item.

=== Part 4: Wrap-Up (10 min)

1. Verify workload rule compliance (group of 2 vs group of 3).
2. Prepare final links for submission.
3. Write a short retrospective.

== Deliverables

At the end of the lab, each team should provide:

1. Link to `M1 Team Board`.
2. Link to all created issues (or issue filter).
3. Link to merged PRs showing `Closes #...`.
4. Short retrospective (3-5 lines): what worked and what blocked progress.
