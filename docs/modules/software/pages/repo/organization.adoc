== Overview

This document outlines a recommended repository organization for a C++20 project that uses CMake for build configuration and CTest for testing. 
In this structure, source files—including both library code and application code—are placed under the `src/` directory. 
Libraries and applications are organized into separate subdirectories to clearly delineate reusable components from executable projects.

== Recommended Directory Structure

[source,none]
----
my_project/
├── .github/

== Top-Level CMake Configuration

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` configures the project and delegates to subdirectories for libraries, applications, and tests.

[source,cmake]
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(MyProject VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

# Require C++20.
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
set(CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF)

# (Optional) Include custom CMake modules.
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules")

# Add subdirectories.
add_subdirectory(src/libs/)
add_subdirectory(src/apps/)
add_subdirectory(tests)
----

== Library Configuration (src/libs/lib1/CMakeLists.txt)

This configuration builds the library and sets the public include directories. Note that the public headers reside alongside the source files.

[source,cmake]
----
# Create the library target from your implementation files.
add_library(lib1
    module1.cpp
    # Add other source files as needed.
)

# Since public headers live alongside the source files, make the current directory public.
target_include_directories(lib1
    PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
)

# (Optional) Set additional compile options, warnings, etc.
target_compile_options(lib1 PRIVATE -Wall -Wextra -pedantic)
----

== Application Configuration (src/apps/app1/CMakeLists.txt)

Each application lives in its own subdirectory under `src/apps/`. Below is an example configuration for an application.

[source,cmake]
----
# Define the executable for app1.
add_executable(app1 main.cpp)

# Link the executable with your library.
target_link_libraries(app1 PRIVATE lib1)

# Optionally, specify additional include directories if required.
----

== Tests Configuration (tests/CMakeLists.txt)

The tests are configured using CTest. You may integrate a testing framework (e.g., GoogleTest, Catch2, Boost.Test) as needed.

[source,cmake]
----
enable_testing()

# Create an executable for the tests.
add_executable(my_project_tests
    test_main.cpp
    test_module1.cpp
    # Add more test files as needed.
)

# Link the library under test.
target_link_libraries(my_project_tests PRIVATE my_project_lib)

# Register the tests with CTest.
add_test(NAME AllTests COMMAND my_project_tests)
----

== GitHub Actions CI Workflow

This sample GitHub Actions workflow (located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automates the build and test process.

[source,yaml]
----
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Configure CMake
        run: cmake -S . -B build

      - name: Build
        run: cmake --build build -- -j $(nproc)

      - name: Run tests
        run: cmake --build build --target test
----

== Additional Best Practices

* **Out-of-Source Builds:**  
  Always build in a separate directory (e.g., `build/`) and add it to your `.gitignore` to keep your repository clean.
* **Documentation:**  
  Include clear build, test, and usage instructions in your `README.md` and maintain detailed documentation in the `docs/` folder.
* **Versioning and Releases:**  
  Use Git tags to mark release points and consider using GitHub Releases for packaged binaries.
* **Consistent Code Style:**  
  Integrate formatting tools (such as clang-format) and maintain a coding style guide.
* **Continuous Integration:**  
  Automate builds and tests with CI (as demonstrated) to ensure cross-platform reliability.
* **Branching Strategy:**  
  Use feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews to maintain high code quality.
