:description: Learn about system and software-specific package managers including apt, yum, pip, conda, and dependency management strategies.

Package managers are essential tools for managing software installations, upgrades, and dependencies. They can be categorized into two main types:

- **System Package Managers**: These manage software at the operating system level, handling native applications and system libraries. Examples include `apt`, `yum`, and `brew`. These package managers deal with system-wide installations, making software available to all users and applications on the system.

- **Software-Specific Package Managers**: Many software ecosystems, such as Python, {cpp}, and Node.js, have their own package managers, which handle dependencies and libraries specifically for that language or platform. Examples include `pip` and `conda` for Python, and `conan` for {cpp}.

While system package managers are responsible for global software installations, software-specific package managers allow for more granular control over project-specific dependencies, often within isolated environments. This ensures that software projects can have the exact versions of libraries they need without interfering with the rest of the system.

Below, we explore the most common system package managers and software-specific package managers.

== System Package Managers

System package managers manage software for the entire operating system, ensuring that all dependencies are properly handled for system-wide applications. They also typically offer a large repository of available software.

=== apt
`apt` is the Advanced Package Tool used in Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Debian itself, for managing software packages.

- Widely used in HPC environments to manage dependencies and software stacks.

== Software-Specific Package Managers

In addition to system package managers, specific languages or platforms often have their own package management tools, allowing for fine-tuned control over dependencies and libraries for individual projects. These package managers often integrate with virtual environments to isolate project-specific dependencies.

=== Python 

Python has two main package managers: `pip` and `conda`, both designed to manage Python libraries and packages.

==== pip
`pip` is the default package manager for Python and is used to install and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

.Common Commands with `pip`
[source,bash]
----
# Install a Python package (e.g., numpy)
pip install numpy

# Upgrade a Python package
pip install --upgrade numpy

# Uninstall a Python package
pip uninstall numpy

# List installed Python packages
pip list

# Show detailed information about an installed package
pip show numpy
----

.Key Features of `pip`
- Simple and fast for installing Python libraries and packages from PyPI.
- Works with virtual environments (`venv`) to isolate project dependencies.
- Highly integrated with Python, making it the go-to package manager for most Python users.

.Managing Virtual Environments with `pip`
[source,bash]
----
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source myenv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install packages inside the virtual environment
pip install numpy

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
----

==== conda
`conda` is a more versatile package manager that manages not only Python packages but also libraries and software across different languages and platforms. It is commonly used with the Anaconda distribution for data science and machine learning.

.Common Commands with `conda`
[source,bash]
----
# Create a new environment with specific Python version
conda create --name myenv python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate myenv

# Install a Python package (e.g., pandas)
conda install pandas

# Install a non-Python package (e.g., hdf5)
conda install hdf5

# List installed packages in the environment
conda list

# Remove a package from the environment
conda remove numpy

# Deactivate the environment
conda deactivate

# Remove the entire environment
conda env remove --name myenv
----
