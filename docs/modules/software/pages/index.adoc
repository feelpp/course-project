:description: Master software installation techniques from package managers to building from source. Learn dependency management, troubleshooting, and best practices for development environments.

== Introduction to Software Installation

Learn comprehensive software installation methods through these focused modules:

=== Understanding Package Managers

- What is `apt`?
- Advantages of using package managers.

=== Why Build from Source?
- Latest features and updates.
- Customization and optimization.
- Situations where packages aren't available.

=== Build Systems Overview
- Introduction to build systems like Autotools and CMake.
- Differences and use cases.

== Setting Up the Development Environment with Codespaces

=== Introduction to GitHub Codespaces
- What is Codespaces?
- Benefits over traditional VMs.

=== Getting Started
[source,shell]
----
# Create a Codespace from a repository
git clone <repository-url>
# Open it in GitHub Codespaces
----

=== Environment Configuration
- Install necessary extensions and tools within Codespaces.

== Installing Software Using `apt` in Codespaces

=== Using the Terminal in Codespaces
- Accessing the terminal.
- Running `apt` commands within Codespaces.

=== Practical Examples
[source,shell]
----
# Update and upgrade
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install GNU Octave and Gnuplot
sudo apt install octave gnuplot
----

== Building and Installing Software from Source

=== Preparation
[source,shell]
----
# Install essential build tools
sudo apt install build-essential
----

=== Understanding Build Systems
- **Autotools** (`./configure`, `make`, `make install`)
- **CMake** (`cmake`, `make`, `make install`)

=== General Steps with Autotools
[source,shell]
----
# Download source code
wget <source-url>

# Unpack the archive
tar -xzvf <archive-name>

# Navigate to the directory
cd <source-directory>

# Configure the build
./configure

# Compile the source code
make

# Install the compiled program
sudo make install
----

=== General Steps with CMake
[source,shell]
----
# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure the build
cmake ..

# Compile the source code
make

# Install the compiled program
sudo make install
----

== Hands-On Installation Exercises

=== Exercise 1: Installing FFTW with Autotools
[source,shell]
----
# Using apt
sudo apt install libfftw3-dev

# From source with Autotools
wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.10.tar.gz
tar -xzvf fftw-3.3.10.tar.gz
cd fftw-3.3.10
./configure --enable-shared
make
sudo make install
----

=== Exercise 2: Installing Eigen with CMake
[source,shell]
----
# Using apt
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev

# From source with CMake
wget https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf eigen-3.4.0.tar.gz
cd eigen-3.4.0
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
----

== Managing Dependencies

=== Identifying Missing Dependencies
- Reading `README` and `INSTALL` files.
- Using error messages to find missing packages.

=== Installing Dependencies via `apt`
[source,shell]
----
# Example: Installing Boost libraries
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
----

=== Handling Dependencies in CMake and Autotools
- Using `cmake` flags to specify paths.
- Configuring `./configure` with options.

== Troubleshooting Installation Issues

=== Common Errors
- Missing header files.
- Permission issues.
- Incorrect CMake configurations.

=== Debugging Techniques
[source,shell]
----
# Autotools verbose mode
./configure --help
make VERBOSE=1

# CMake verbose mode
cmake .. -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON
----

== Best Practices

=== System Maintenance in Codespaces
- Managing storage and resources.
- Keeping the environment clean.

=== Version Control
[source,shell]
----
# Cloning repositories for source builds
git clone <repository-url>
----

=== Uninstallation
[source,shell]
----
# Removing packages
sudo apt remove [package-name]

# Uninstalling source installations (Autotools)
sudo make uninstall
----

== Advanced Topics

=== Customizing Builds
- Using `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` for interactive configuration.
- Passing options to `./configure`, e.g., `--prefix`, `--enable/disable` features.

=== Creating Reproducible Environments
- Using Dockerfiles within Codespaces.

=== Continuous Integration
- Setting up GitHub Actions to automate builds and tests.

== Q&A and Discussion

Encourage students to share their experiences and address specific software installation questions.
