= Git for Beginners

This tutorial introduces the basic concepts of Git, a version control system used for tracking changes in software development.

== What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. 
It tracks changes to files, enables collaboration, and makes it easy to revert changes when needed.

== Git Basics

=== Installing Git

To check if Git is already installed, open a terminal and run:

[source,console]
----
$ git --version
----

If Git is not installed, follow these instructions based on your operating system:

* **Linux**: Use the package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, or `yum`).
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install git
----

* **macOS**: Install Git using Homebrew:
[source,console]
----
$ brew install git
----

* **Windows**: Download and install Git from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com

=== Configuring Git

Before you start using Git, you need to configure your user information. This information will be used in your commits.

[source,console]
----
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
----

To check your configuration:
[source,console]
----
$ git config --list
----

=== Creating a Repository

A Git repository is where Git stores all the files, changes, and history of your project.

To create a new Git repository:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ git init
----

This initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.

=== Cloning a Repository

If you want to work on an existing Git project, you can clone a repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
----

This command copies the project from the remote repository to your local machine.

=== Checking the Status of Your Repository

To check the current status of your working directory and staged changes:

[source,console]
----
$ git status
----

This will show which files have been modified, staged, or committed.

=== Staging Changes

After making changes to your files, you need to stage them for commit. To stage a specific file:

[source,console]
----
$ git add <file-name>
----

To stage all changes at once:

[source,console]
----
$ git add .
----

=== Committing Changes

Once your changes are staged, you can commit them to the repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git commit -m "Commit message describing the changes"
----

The `-m` option allows you to add a short message describing your changes.

=== Viewing the Commit History

To view the commit history of your repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git log
----

This will display a list of commits with details like the commit hash, author, and message.

For a compact view of the commit history:

[source,console]
----
$ git log --oneline
----

=== Undoing Changes

To discard changes to a file:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -- <file-name>
----

To unstage a file (move it out of the staging area):

[source,console]
----
$ git reset <file-name>
----

To reset your last commit (without losing your changes):

[source,console]
----
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
----



=== Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

To push your local commits to a remote repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin <branch-name>
----

This sends your changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).

=== Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository

To fetch and merge changes from a remote repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git pull origin <branch-name>
----

This updates your local branch with any new commits from the remote branch.

== Summary

This tutorial covers the basic Git commands for working with a repository. Understanding these core concepts will help you collaborate more effectively and manage your projectâ€™s version history.
