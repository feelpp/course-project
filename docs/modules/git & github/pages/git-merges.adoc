This document explains the different merge strategies available in Git. You will learn about fast-forward vs non-fast-forward merges, how to rebase, squash commits, handle conflicts, and cherry-pick specific commits.

== Fast-Forward vs Non-Fast-Forward Merges

When you merge two branches in Git, you can either perform a fast-forward merge or a non-fast-forward merge, depending on whether the two branches have diverged.

=== Fast-Forward Merge

A fast-forward merge occurs when the current branch has no new commits and can be "fast-forwarded" to the tip of the target branch. This happens when there is a direct linear path between the two branches.

To perform a fast-forward merge:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature-branch
----

If there are no new commits on `main`, Git will simply move the `main` branch pointer to the tip of `feature-branch`.

=== Non-Fast-Forward Merge

A non-fast-forward merge occurs when the branches have diverged, meaning both branches have new commits. Git will create a new merge commit to combine the histories of the two branches.

To perform a non-fast-forward merge:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout main
$ git merge --no-ff feature-branch
----

The `--no-ff` flag ensures that even if the merge could be fast-forwarded, Git will create a merge commit to maintain a clear record of the merge.

== Rebase

Rebasing allows you to apply changes from one branch on top of another branch, creating a clean, linear history. Instead of merging, which keeps both sets of commits, rebase rewrites the commit history by moving your changes to the tip of another branch.

To rebase your feature branch onto the main branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout feature-branch
$ git rebase main
----

After rebasing, the commits from `feature-branch` will appear as if they were made after the `main` branch’s commits. Once rebased, you can merge it with a fast-forward merge.

== Squash Commits

Squashing commits combines multiple commits into a single commit, which simplifies the commit history, especially for feature branches that have several small or work-in-progress commits.

To squash your commits during a rebase:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout feature-branch
$ git rebase -i main
----

This will open an interactive rebase where you can replace `pick` with `squash` for commits you want to squash. Once done, save and close the editor.

You can also squash directly during the merge by running:

[source,console]
----
$ git merge --squash feature-branch
----

This will merge all changes from `feature-branch` into a single commit on `main`.

== Handling Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git cannot automatically merge the changes because the same part of a file has been modified in both branches. When a conflict happens, Git will mark the conflict in the affected files.

To resolve merge conflicts:

1. Open the conflicting files, and you’ll see conflict markers like:

[source]
----
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the main branch
=======
This is the feature branch
>>>>>>>
----

2. Manually edit the file to include the correct changes, then stage the resolved files:

[source,console]
----
$ git add <file-name>
----

3. After resolving all conflicts, commit the merge:

[source,console]
----
$ git commit
----

You can view conflicts during a merge with:

[source,console]
----
$ git status
----

== Cherry-Picking Commits

Cherry-picking allows you to apply specific commits from one branch onto another branch without merging the entire branch. This is useful when you only want to bring in selected changes.

To cherry-pick a commit:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout main
$ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
----

Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual commit hash you want to pick. Git will apply that commit onto your current branch.

If conflicts occur during cherry-picking, you can resolve them in the same way as during a merge.

== Summary

This guide explains the different merge strategies in Git, from fast-forward and non-fast-forward merges to more advanced techniques like rebase, squash, handling conflicts, and cherry-picking. These tools allow you to manage changes effectively while maintaining a clean commit history.
