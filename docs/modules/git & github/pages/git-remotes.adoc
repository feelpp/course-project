= Git Remotes

This tutorial explains how to work with remotes in Git. 
Remotes are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network, allowing you to collaborate with others. 
We’ll cover how to clone repositories, manage remotes, push/pull changes, and fetch without merging.


== Cloning Repositories

Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository. This is often the first step when working with existing projects hosted on Git platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

To clone a repository, run:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
----

This command will create a directory named after the repository and initialize it with all of the project’s files, commits, and branches from the remote repository.

After cloning, navigate into the repository folder:

[source,console]
----
$ cd <repository-name>
----

You now have a local copy of the project, which is linked to the remote repository (typically named `origin`).

== Managing Remotes

Remotes allow you to track and push/pull changes between your local project and the remote repositories.

=== Listing Remotes

To list the remotes configured for the repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote -v
----

This will display the URLs of all remotes along with their read/write privileges.

=== Adding a Remote

You can add additional remotes if needed, such as for collaborating with multiple developers or managing multiple upstream repositories. For example, to add a new remote named `upstream`:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/other-user/repo.git
----

Now, your repository will track the original repository (usually `origin`) and the additional remote (`upstream`).

=== Renaming or Removing a Remote

To rename a remote:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
----

For example:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote rename origin main-remote
----

To remove a remote:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote remove <remote-name>
----

For example:

[source,console]
----
$ git remote remove upstream
----

== Pushing and Pulling Changes

Pushing and pulling are fundamental Git operations that allow you to synchronize changes between your local repository and the remote repository.

=== Pushing Changes

To push changes from your local branch to a remote repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin <branch-name>
----

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push. This uploads your local commits to the remote branch.

If you're pushing for the first time and want to set the upstream reference (so you can push without specifying the branch name in the future), run:

[source,console]
----
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
----

=== Pulling Changes

To pull changes from a remote repository into your local branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git pull origin <branch-name>
----

This command fetches the changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.

== Fetch without Merge

If you want to get changes from a remote repository without merging them into your current branch, you can use the `git fetch` command. Fetching does not affect your working directory but allows you to inspect changes before deciding to merge.

To fetch changes from a remote repository:

[source,console]
----
$ git fetch origin
----

After fetching, you can inspect what has changed by using `git log` or `git diff`.

If you want to see the changes fetched but not yet merged:

[source,console]
----
$ git log origin/<branch-name> --not HEAD
----

This shows the commits in the remote branch that are not yet in your local branch.

To merge the changes after fetching, use:

[source,console]
----
$ git merge origin/<branch-name>
----

== Summary

This tutorial covered the essentials of working with Git remotes. You now know how to:
- Clone repositories from remote sources.
- Manage remotes by adding, renaming, or removing them.
- Push and pull changes to keep your local and remote repositories in sync.
- Fetch changes from the remote without merging to review updates before integrating them.

These are key concepts for working collaboratively with Git, allowing you to efficiently manage code across multiple contributors and environments.
