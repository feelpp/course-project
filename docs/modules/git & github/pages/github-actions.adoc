= Tutorial: Using GitHub Actions for Scientific Computing
Author: Christophe Prud'homme

This tutorial explains how to use GitHub Actions to automate essential tasks in scientific computing projects, such as building code, testing, benchmarking, and deploying documentation.

TIP: Before starting this tutorial, please study the following resources on xref:software/package-managers.adoc[Package Managers].

== 1. Introduction to GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is an automation tool that allows you to create custom workflows directly in your GitHub repositories. For scientific computing, this is particularly useful for continuous integration (CI) tasks like:

* Automatically building your code when a new commit is pushed.
* Running tests to ensure code correctness.
* Running benchmarks to track performance.

Each workflow is defined in a YAML file under the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. A typical GitHub Actions workflow consists of `jobs` that run on specific `runners` (virtual machines). Below is an example of a basic workflow:

[source,yaml]
----
name: CI Workflow <1>
on: [push, pull_request] <2>
jobs: <3>
  build: <4>
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest <4>
    steps: <5>
      - name: Checkout repository <6>
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 <7>
----
<.> **`name:`**: Descriptive name for the workflow.
<.> **`on:`**: Defines events that trigger the workflow (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).
<.> **`jobs:`**: Contains tasks that run in sequence or in parallel.
<.> **`build:`**: Name of the job, this is user-defined.
<.> **`runs-on:`**: Specifies the runner environment (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
<.> **`steps:`**: Contains a list of actions to perform in the job.
<.> **`uses:`**: Specifies the action to use (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`).
<.> **`actions/checkout@v4`**: An action that checks out your repository code.

== 2. Setting Up a Simple GitHub Actions Workflow

To start, create a simple workflow that runs when code is pushed or a pull request is opened.

=== Step 1: Create the Workflow File

1. Create the directory `.github/workflows/` in your repository.
2. Inside this directory, create a file named `ci.yml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: CI for Scientific Computing

on: [push, pull_request] 

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: View the repository content <1>
        run: tree <2>
----
<1> **`name:`**: Descriptive name for the step.
<2> **`run:`**: Executes the specified command `tree` to view the repository content.
+
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
4. Go to the btn:[**Actions**] tab on your GitHub repository to see the workflow **CI for Scientific Computing** in action.


== 3. Installing Dependencies in Scientific Projects

Scientific computing projects often require installing dependencies like libraries or tools (e.g., **CMake**, **MPI**, or **Python packages**).

=== Step 1: Installing System Dependencies Using `apt`

You can install system dependencies using the `apt` package manager. 

Here's an example of installing **CMake** and **g++**:

.Example
[.examp]
====
if your project depends on **CMake**, **g++**, and **eigen3**, you can add the following step:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y cmake g++ libeigen3-dev
----
====

=== Step 2: Using Conda for Python and Scientific Libraries

For Python-based scientific computing projects, you can use **Conda** to manage dependencies:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Set up Conda environment
    uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
    with:
      environment-file: environment.yml
      auto-activate-base: false

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: conda install -c conda-forge numpy scipy matplotlib
----

== 4. Automating Build and Test Processes

Automating the build and test processes is essential in scientific computing. Here's how to compile and test code using **CMake** in GitHub Actions.

=== Step 1: Compiling Code with CMake

If you're using **CMake** as your build system, you can configure, build, and test your project using the following steps:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Configure with CMake
    run: |
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make

  - name: Run tests
    run: |
      cd build
      make test
----

=== Step 2: Testing Multiple Configurations with Matrix Builds

Matrix builds allow you to test your code across different configurations or platforms. For example, testing on both **gcc** and **clang**:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        compiler: [gcc, clang]
    steps:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: sudo apt install -y cmake gfortran

      - name: Configure and build
        run: |
          mkdir build
          cd build
          cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=${{ matrix.compiler }}
          make
----

== 5. Running Benchmarks in GitHub Actions

Running performance benchmarks helps ensure that your code maintains its efficiency. You can automate benchmark runs with GitHub Actions:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - name: Run benchmarks
    run: ./build/my_benchmark_tool --iterations 1000

  - name: Save benchmark results
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: benchmark-results
      path: results/
----

=== Key Action: `upload-artifact`

* **`upload-artifact`**: This action allows you to upload files generated during the workflow (e.g., benchmark results or log files) for future reference.

== 6. Deploying Documentation Automatically

Scientific projects often require documentation that can be auto-generated with tools like **Doxygen** or **Sphinx**. This section demonstrates how to deploy documentation to **GitHub Pages**.

=== Step 1: Example Workflow for Deploying Doxygen Documentation

[source,yaml]
----
name: Deploy Doxygen Docs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Doxygen
        run: sudo apt install -y doxygen

      - name: Generate Documentation
        run: doxygen Doxyfile

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./docs/html
----

=== Key Actions:

* **`checkout`**: This action clones the repository into the workflow environment.
* **`upload-artifact`**: Allows you to upload generated documentation or reports.
* **`download-artifact`**: Retrieves previously uploaded files for use in later steps or jobs.

== 7. Advanced CI Features for Scientific Computing

GitHub Actions can be extended with advanced features such as Docker for reproducible builds or caching to speed up workflow execution.

=== Step 1: Using Docker for Reproducible Builds

Docker ensures that your workflow runs in a consistent environment. You can specify a custom Docker image for the runner:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: my-custom-image:latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build project
        run: make
----

=== Step 2: Caching Dependencies

Caching dependencies speeds up workflows by saving dependencies across multiple runs. Here's an example of caching **CMake** build files:

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
  - uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: build
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-cmake-${{ hashFiles('CMakeLists.txt') }}
----

== 8. Monitoring and Analyzing CI Performance

Monitoring the health of your project is crucial in scientific computing. 
You can set up badges in your **README.adoc** file to display the current status of your builds.

=== Step 1: Setting Up Status Badges

To set up a status badge for your GitHub Actions workflow:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg[Build Status]
----

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with the appropriate values for your repository.

== Conclusion

By using GitHub Actions, you can automate key tasks in scientific computing projects, such as building code, running tests, benchmarking, and deploying documentation. This tutorial covered setting up a basic workflow, installing dependencies, and using advanced features like caching and Docker.

== Next Steps

== Appendix: Using the CMake Tools Extension and Presets in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

The **CMake Tools** extension for VSCode makes it easy to manage CMake projects and build configurations. It directly supports **CMake Presets**, allowing you to configure, build, and run your project without manually invoking CMake from the command line. Here's how to integrate **CMake Presets** into your VSCode workflow.

=== Step 1: Install the CMake Tools Extension

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to the btn:[**Extensions**] view by clicking the Extensions icon on the left sidebar or pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+X].
3. Search for btn:[**CMake Tools**] by Microsoft.
4. Click btn:[**Install**] to add the extension.

Once installed, the btn:[**CMake Tools**] extension will automatically detect the `CMakeLists.txt` file in your project and set up CMake accordingly.

=== Step 2: Configure Your Project with Presets

With the **CMake Presets** already defined in your project (`CMakePresets.json`), VSCode will automatically detect and allow you to use them. Follow these steps to configure and build your project using the presets:

1. **Open the Command Palette**:
   - Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] to open the Command Palette.
   - Type btn:[CMake: Select Configure Preset] and choose this command.

2. **Select a Preset**:
   - VSCode will show a list of the presets defined in your `CMakePresets.json` file.
   - For example, select `debug` or `release`, depending on the build type you want.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   - After selecting a preset, VSCode will run the CMake configuration using that preset.
   - You can view the progress in the **CMake** output tab at the bottom of the editor.

=== Step 3: Building the Project

After configuring the project with a preset, you can build it using VSCode's integrated build system.

1. **Build the Project**:
   - Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+B] or open the Command Palette (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P]) and type `CMake: Build`.
   - Select the build target (usually `all`).
   - The project will be built using the previously selected preset (e.g., `debug` or `release`).
   - The build progress and results will be displayed in the **CMake: Build** output tab.

=== Step 4: Running the Executable

Once the project is built, you can easily run the generated executable from within VSCode:

1. **Run the Executable**:
   - Open the Command Palette (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P]) and type `CMake: Run Without Debugging`.
   - VSCode will automatically detect the built binary and run it.
   - The output of the program will be shown in the terminal within VSCode.

=== Step 5: Debugging the Executable

VSCode also provides integrated debugging capabilities, which are particularly useful for debugging scientific computing applications:

1. **Start Debugging**:
   - Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter to the left of the line numbers.
   - Open the Command Palette (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P]) and type `CMake: Debug`.
   - The executable will be launched in the debugger, and you can inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the call stack.

=== Step 6: Managing Multiple Presets

If you have multiple configurations (e.g., `debug` and `release`), you can easily switch between them in VSCode:

1. **Select a Different Preset**:
   - Open the Command Palette (kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P]) and type `CMake: Select Configure Preset`.
   - Choose the desired preset, and VSCode will reconfigure the project based on that preset.

2. **Build and Run the Project**:
   - Use the same steps as above to build and run the project with the new configuration.

=== Summary

The **CMake Tools** extension in VSCode provides a seamless way to manage CMake projects, especially when using **CMake Presets**. With the extension, you can easily configure, build, and run your project, and even debug it, all from within the VSCode environment.

=== Key Benefits of Using VSCode with CMake Presets:

* Simplified project configuration and building process.
* Easy switching between different build configurations (e.g., `debug` and `release`).
* Integrated terminal and debugging capabilities.
* Clear output and error messages within the editor.

By integrating **CMake Presets** with **VSCode**, you streamline both local development and CI workflows, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different environments.
