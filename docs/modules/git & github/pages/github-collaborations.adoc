= Collaboration on GitHub
:experimental: true

This page introduces key GitHub features for collaboration, including forking vs cloning, issues, pull requests, labeling issues/PRs, and more. These tools help streamline collaboration and code review in open source and team projects.

== Forking vs Cloning

GitHub provides two ways to work with repositories: **forking** and **cloning**.

- **Forking**: Creates a copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account. You can modify this copy and later propose changes to the original repository via a pull request (PR).
- **Cloning**: Downloads a local copy of a repository on your machine so you can work on it. You can clone both your own and other users' repositories (public repositories).

=== Forking a Repository


.Forking a Repository
image::collaboration/fork.png[Forking a Repository]

To fork a repository:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the btn:[Fork] button in the upper-right corner.
3. Choose the location (your account) to create the fork.

After forking, you can clone it to your local machine:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
----


=== Cloning a Repository

.Cloning a Repository

To clone a repository (without forking):

[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
----

Replace `<username>` with the repository owner's username.


NOTE: in VS Code, to clone a repository, you can use the `Git: Clone` command from the command palette btn:[Ctrl+Shift+P] on Linux, see xref:vscode:cheatsheet.adoc[] and provide the repository URL.


== Issues

.Issue Tab
image::collaboration/issues.png[Issue Tab]

GitHub Issues provide a way to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks for a project. 
Each issue has its own discussion thread, and developers can assign issues, add labels, and link them to pull requests.

.Create a New Issue
image::collaboration/issues-creation.png[Create a New Issue]

To create a new issue:

1. Navigate to the repository.
2. Click on the btn:[Issues] tab.
3. Click btn:[New issue] and provide a title and description.


=== Closing Issues with Commits

You can close an issue automatically by mentioning it in your commit message:

[source,console]
----
$ git commit -m "Fixes #123 - Update the login functionality"
$ git push origin main
----

This will automatically close issue `#123` when the commit is pushed thanks to the keyword `Fixes` and then the issue number prefixed by `#`.
Similar keywords include `Closes`, `Resolves`, and `Addresses`.

.How to write issues ?
TIP: For guidelines about how to write issues, please refer to xref:github-how-to-write-issues.adoc[].

== Pull Requests (PRs)


A pull request (PR) proposes changes from your branch to the main repository. Other contributors can review the PR, discuss changes, and eventually merge it.

=== Creating a PR

.Create a New PR
image::collaboration/pr.png[Create a PR]

To create a PR after pushing your changes:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the btn:[Pull requests] tab.
3. Click btn:[New pull request], select your branch, and create the PR.

TIP: You can also reference issues related to the PR by mentioning them (e.g., `#123`).

=== PR from a Fork

If you forked a repository and made changes, you can submit a pull request to the original repository.

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin <branch-name>
----

After pushing your changes, create a PR from your fork's repository to the original repository.

=== Collaborators

Repository owners can invite collaborators to work on private repositories. 
Collaborators have write access to the repository.

To add a collaborator:

1. Navigate to the repository settings.
2. Under the btn:[Manage access] tab, invite the collaborator by their GitHub username.

== Labelling Issues / PRs

Labels help organize and categorize issues and PRs. GitHub provides default labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, and `question`, but you can create custom labels.

To add labels to an issue or PR:

1. Open the issue/PR.
2. Click btn:[Labels] on the right-hand side.
3. Choose the labels to apply.

== Saved Replies

Saved replies allow you to create and reuse common responses for issues and pull requests. 
This is useful for repeating instructions, responses, or comments.

To create a saved reply:

1. Navigate to your profile settings.
2. Under btn:[Saved replies], add a new reply template.
3. Use it while commenting on issues or pull requests.

== Mentions

.Message Mention
image::collaboration/mention.png[Message Mention]


To get someone's attention in an issue or pull request, you can mention them using `@` followed by their GitHub username. For example:

[source,console]
----
@octocat Can you review this PR?
----

This sends a notification to the mentioned user.

== Reactions

.Reaction
image::collaboration/reaction.png[Raction]

GitHub allows you to react to comments, issues, and pull requests with emojis such as 👍 (thumbs up) and ❤️ (heart). Reactions help gauge community feedback without adding comments.

To react to a comment:

1. Hover over the comment.
2. Click the smiley face icon and select a reaction.

== Commenting

.Comments
image::collaboration/comment.png[Comments]

Comments can be added to issues, pull requests, and specific lines of code in a pull request diff. Comments are a key part of GitHub's review and discussion process.

To comment on an issue or PR:

1. Open the btn:[issue] or btn:[Pull Request] tabs.
2. Scroll down to the comment box.
3. Write your comment and click btn:[Comment].

For code review, you can leave line-by-line comments directly on the PR diff.

== GitHub Discussions

.Discussions
image::collaboration/discussions.png[Discussions]

GitHub Discussions is a feature that provides a space for long-form conversations separate from issues. Discussions are often used for community engagement, Q&A, and planning.

To create a discussion:

1. Navigate to the btn:[Discussions] tab of a repository.
2. Click btn:[New Discussion] and choose a category.
3. Write your discussion topic and post it.

Discussions allow voting, threading, and marking answers as "solved."


.A New Discussion
image::collaboration/discussion-created.png[A New Discussion]


After the discussion is created, community members can participate by replying, voting, or marking answers.

The discussions tab provides a nice way to engage with the community and gather feedback.

.Discussion View
