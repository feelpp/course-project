:description: Master Git branching concepts including creating, switching, merging branches, and managing parallel development workflows.

=== Branching Basics

Branches are essential for managing workflows in Git. A branch represents a separate line of development and allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

A few key terms:
* **Main branch**: The default branch in a Git repository (commonly `main` or `master`).
* **Feature branch**: A branch created for developing new features or fixes.

=== Creating a Branch

To create a new branch from the current branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch <branch-name>
----

For example, to create a branch called `feature/new-ui`:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch feature/new-ui
----

This command creates the branch, but you’re still on your current branch. To switch to the new branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout feature/new-ui
----

Alternatively, you can create and switch to the new branch in one step:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout -b feature/new-ui
----

This is a best practice for starting new features or fixes in isolated branches, ensuring the main codebase remains stable.

=== Renaming a Branch

To rename the current branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -m <new-branch-name>
----

If you’re not on the branch you want to rename, specify both the old and new branch names:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>
----

For example, to rename `feature/new-ui` to `feature/new-design`:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -m feature/new-ui feature/new-design
----

After renaming, if the branch has been pushed to a remote, you will also need to push the renamed branch and delete the old one from the remote:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin -u <new-branch-name>
$ git push origin --delete <old-branch-name>
----

=== Deleting a Branch

Once a feature branch has been merged or is no longer needed, it’s good practice to delete it to keep the repository clean.

To delete a local branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -d <branch-name>
----

If you want to force delete the branch (for example, if the branch contains unmerged changes), use:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -D <branch-name>
----

To delete a branch on a remote (like GitHub):

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin --delete <branch-name>
----

For example, to delete a branch called `feature/new-ui` locally and remotely:

[source,console]
----
$ git branch -d feature/new-ui
$ git push origin --delete feature/new-ui
----

=== Checking Out a Branch

Switching between branches is called "checking out" a branch. To switch to another branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout <branch-name>
----

For example, to switch to the `develop` branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout develop
----

=== Merging Basics

Once your feature or fix is complete, you’ll want to merge it back into the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

To merge another branch into your current branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git merge <branch-name>
----

For example, if you are on the `main` branch and want to merge changes from the `feature/new-ui` branch:

[source,console]
----
$ git checkout main
$ git merge feature/new-ui
----

After merging, if there are no conflicts, Git will automatically commit the merge.

If conflicts arise, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually. After resolving the conflicts, stage the changes and complete the merge:

[source,console]
----
$ git add <file-name>
$ git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
----

Finally, push the changes to the remote:

[source,console]
----
$ git push origin main
----
