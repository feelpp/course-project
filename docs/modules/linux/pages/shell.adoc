= Linux Shell Basics
:page-jupyter: true

The Linux shell is a command-line interface or terminal used to interact directly with the operating system. 
The shell helps facilitate system commands and acts as an intermediary interface between the user and the systemâ€™s kernel.
The shell can perform complex tasks efficiently and quickly. 
There are many types of shells available in Linux, including the Bourne Shell (`sh`), the C Shell (`csh`), and the Bourne-Again Shell (`bash`).

The basics of using a Linux shell include navigating between directories, creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories, and executing system commands. 
This introductory knowledge is crucial for Linux system administration, scripting, and automation.

Here is a classic bash command as an example, which prints the current directory:

[source,shell]
----
pwd
----

== Command Path

The command path refers to the list of directories that the shell searches when a command is entered. The shell uses the `PATH` environment variable to find commands. If you type a command, the shell will look for that command in each directory listed in your `PATH`, and execute the first match it finds.

View your current command path with the following:

[source,shell]
----
echo $PATH
----

You can modify your `PATH` to include custom directories using:

[source,shell]
----
export PATH=$PATH:/your/custom/directory
----

== Environment Variables

Environment variables are dynamic values that affect the way processes run on the system. Common environment variables include `PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, and `SHELL`.

To view all environment variables, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
printenv
----

You can also set or modify environment variables like this:

[source,shell]
----
export VARIABLE_NAME="value"
----

== Command Help

If you're unsure about how to use a particular command or what options it supports, you can access its manual page by using the `man` command. For example:

[source,shell]
----
man ls
----

Alternatively, many commands offer a `--help` option to quickly display usage information:

[source,shell]
----
ls --help
----

== Redirects

Redirection is used to send the output of a command to a file or another command instead of the terminal. There are several types of redirection:

- **`>`**: Redirects output to a file (overwrites the file if it exists).
- **`>>`**: Appends output to the file.
- **`<`**: Reads input from a file.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
ls > output.txt  # Redirects the output of ls to output.txt
----

You can also pipe the output of one command into another command:

[source,shell]
----
ls | grep "pattern"  # Passes the output of ls to grep to search for a pattern
----

== Super User

Some tasks require administrative (root) privileges to be executed. To run a command as the superuser, you use `sudo` before the command.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt update  # Run system update with superuser privileges
----

You will typically be prompted to enter the password for the superuser account.

[source,shell]
----
# Become the superuser for a terminal session
sudo su
----
