**Why Linux for Mathematicians?**

Most mathematical software (MATLAB, Mathematica, SageMath), high-performance computing clusters, and research computing environments run on Linux systems. Understanding basic Linux commands enables you to:

- Access and use computational clusters for large-scale mathematical computations
- Manage mathematical datasets and simulation results efficiently  
- Collaborate with computational scientists and engineers
- Use powerful mathematical software packages available only on Linux

As a mathematics student, you'll frequently need to work with computational tools and high-performance computing systems. Linux skills are essential for accessing mathematical software, managing research data, and running computational experiments.

== Linux Learning Modules

The following modules will guide you through essential Linux skills:

== Basic Linux Navigation Commands

Here is a brief overview of some of the most common commands used for navigation in Linux:

=== `cd` â€“ Change Directory

The `cd` command allows you to move between directories within the filesystem. It is one of the most frequently used commands when navigating the CLI.

Example:

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /tmp
pwd
----

This command will move you to the specified directory. If no path is specified, typing `cd` on its own will take you to your home directory.

- **Absolute Path**: `/tmp/documents` (moves directly to the `documents` directory within `/tmp`)
- **Relative Path**: `../documents` (moves up one directory and into `documents`)

=== `pwd` â€“ Print Working Directory

The `pwd` command prints the full path of your current directory. This is particularly useful when you've navigated through several directories and want to confirm your current location in the filesystem.

Example:

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
mkdir /tmp/documents
cd /tmp/documents
touch file.txt
pwd
----


=== `ls` â€“ List Directory Contents

The `ls` command lists all files and directories within the current directory. By default, it shows a simple list, but there are many options to customize what is displayed.

Basic usage:

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /tmp/documents
ls
----

Additional options:

- `ls -l`: Displays detailed information about each file, such as permissions, owner, size, and modification date.
- `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot).
- `ls -lh`: Displays sizes in human-readable format (KB, MB, etc.).

.ls -l
[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /tmp/documents
ls -l
----

.ls -a
[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /tmp/documents
ls -a
----

=== `tree` â€“ Display Directory Structure

The `tree` command visually displays the directory structure as a tree. Itâ€™s a useful tool for understanding the layout of files and directories.

Example:

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /tmp/documents
tree ..
----

This will output a nested tree structure representing the contents of the current directory and its subdirectories.

== Practical Examples

Here are some practical examples of how you might use these commands:

- **Navigating to a specific directory:**

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /var/log
----

- **Confirming your location in the filesystem:**

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /var/log
pwd
----

- **Listing files in the current directory in detail:**

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /var/log
ls -l
----

- **Viewing the directory structure:**

[%dynamic%open,python]
----
%%bash
cd /var/log
tree
----
