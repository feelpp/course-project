== What is WSL?

**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** allows you to run a Linux distribution natively on Windows. With the **Remote - WSL** extension, you can use VS Code to develop within a WSL environment.

== Installing WSL and the Extension

. Install WSL on your Windows machine: https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install
. Install your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
. In VS Code, open the Extensions panel (kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + X]) and install the "Remote - WSL" extension.

== Using WSL in VS Code

Once installed, you can open a WSL session in VS Code by pressing `F1` and selecting **Remote-WSL: New Window**. This will open VS Code in the WSL environment, allowing you to code and run commands directly in Linux.
