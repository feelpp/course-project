**Why VS Code for Mathematics?**

An integrated development environment helps mathematicians:
- **Write LaTeX documents** with syntax highlighting and live preview
- **Develop mathematical code** in Python, R, or MATLAB with debugging support
- **Manage version control** visually with Git integration
- **Work with Jupyter notebooks** for mathematical analysis
- **Collaborate efficiently** with shared workspace configurations

VS Code unifies all your mathematical computing tools in one interface.
