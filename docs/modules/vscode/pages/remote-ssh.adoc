== What is Remote SSH?

The **Remote SSH** extension allows you to connect to a remote server and work on files, debug, and run commands directly on the remote machine.

== Installing the Remote SSH Extension

1. Open the Extensions panel in VS Code (kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + X]).
2. Search for "Remote - SSH" and click btn:[Install].

== Setting up Remote SSH

. Press kbd:[F1] or kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+P] or on MacOS kbd:[Cmd+Shift+P] and type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host" in the Command Palette.
. Enter the SSH connection details, e.g., `ssh user@remote-server.com`.
. VS Code will connect to the remote machine, allowing you to use it as if it were local.

You can also edit your SSH config file to save the connection details for quick access.
