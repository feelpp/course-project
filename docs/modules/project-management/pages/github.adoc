= GitHub for Project Management
:page-tags: project-management
:description: Use GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Projects to plan, track, and deliver team work in a structured way.

[.lead]
GitHub can be used as a lightweight but robust project management system for student teams: define tasks, assign ownership, track progress, review work, and deliver increments.

== Why Use GitHub for PM in M1

- One platform for code, tasks, reviews, and automation.
- Traceability from idea to merged contribution.
- Good habits for research and engineering collaboration.
- Works for small teams without heavy tooling overhead.

== Core Building Blocks

=== Issues

Use issues to represent work items:

- Feature tasks
- Bug reports
- Documentation tasks
- Technical debt and maintenance

Recommended issue fields:

- Clear title
- Short context/problem statement
- Acceptance criteria
- Labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`)
- Assignee(s)
- Milestone (for sprint/release grouping)

NOTE: Milestones can track both issues and pull requests.

=== Pull Requests

Use pull requests as your quality gate:

- Link PRs to issues (`Closes #123`)
- Request at least one review
- Require checks to pass before merge
- Keep PRs small and focused

=== GitHub Projects (current version)

Use GitHub Projects (table/board/roadmap) to organize and prioritize team work.

IMPORTANT: Projects (classic) was sunset on GitHub.com in 2024 and removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.17 (June 3, 2025). Use the current GitHub Projects experience.

== Recommended Team Setup (Week 2)

For a 3-5 student team:

1. Create labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`.
2. Create one milestone: `Sprint-1`.
3. Create one project at organization/user level: `M1 Team Board`.
4. Add fields:
- `Status`: `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`
- `Priority`: `P1`, `P2`, `P3`
- `Effort`: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`
5. Create views:
- `Backlog` (table)
- `Current Sprint` (board grouped by `Status`)
- `Roadmap` (roadmap layout, grouped by milestone/date)

== Suggested Weekly Ritual (30-45 min)

1. Triage new issues.
2. Prioritize `P1` work.
3. Ensure each active item has an owner.
4. Move max 2-3 items/person to `In Progress`.
5. Review blocked items and add explicit unblock actions.
6. Merge completed PRs and move linked project items to `Done`.

== Practical Workflow (Issue -> PR -> Project)

1. Create an issue for each task.
2. Assign owner and labels; add milestone.
3. Add issue to project.
4. Open branch and implement change.
5. Open PR with `Closes #issue_number`.
6. Review + pass checks + merge.
7. Verify issue closed and project item updated.

This keeps planning and execution synchronized.

== Common Pitfalls

- Tasks too large (split into smaller issues).
- Missing ownership (no assignee, unclear responsibility).
- Project board not maintained after merges.
- PRs opened without linked issue.
- Labels used inconsistently across the team.
