:description: Understand project fundamentals including definition, characteristics, deliverables, constraints, and key success factors.

== Definition of a Project

* A sequence of tasks:
** Planned from beginning to end
** Bounded by time, resources, & specific results
* Defined outcomes and "deliverables"
* Has a deadline and a budget
** Limits number of people, supplies, and capital

[quote, NOTE]
____
A project is a structured, goal-driven effort with clear boundaries and constraints. Outlining these elements clearly from the start is crucial for success.
____

[.slide]
== Tasks vs. Projects

Routine tasks:

- Responding to email
- Making coffee
- Hooking up a printer

Projects:

- Producing a customer newsletter
- Catering a party
- Writing a book
- Implementing a computer network

[quote, NOTE]
____
Tasks are often short-term and repetitive, while projects are complex, unique, and require strategic planning and coordination.
____

[.slide]
== Five Features of a Project

1. Defined beginning, end, schedule, and approach
2. Use of specific resources allocated to the work
3. Achievement of defined goals (time, cost, performance/quality)
4. Follows a planned, organized approach
5. Involves a team of people

[quote, NOTE]
____
A successful project incorporates all five of these features and leads to a defined outcome that meets the objectives.
____

[.slide]
== Resources and Constraints

A project’s success depends on effective management of:

- Time
- People
- Money
- Equipment
- Facilities

[quote, NOTE]
____
Managing resources efficiently is a key factor in ensuring that the project meets its objectives while staying within constraints.
____

[.slide]
== What Makes a Project Successful?

* Organized and well-planned approach
* Commitment from the project team
* Balancing:
** Time
** Resources
** Results
** Customer satisfaction

[quote, NOTE]
____
Success in project management comes from maintaining balance between these factors while adapting to changing conditions.
____

[.slide]
== What is a Program?

- A recurring or ongoing project
- Predictable and repeatable in nature
- Each cycle has a new plan, new resources, and a new end result

[quote, NOTE]
____
While a project is a one-time effort, a program represents a recurring, systematic process that requires fresh planning and resources each time.
____


== What is a Milestone?

A **milestone** in project management is a significant event or point in the project timeline that marks the completion of a major phase or task. Milestones are often used to:

- Measure progress: By marking important points, you can assess if the project is on schedule.
- Highlight deadlines: Milestones represent key deadlines that need to be met to move the project forward.
- Reflect achievements: Reaching a milestone signifies the completion of a critical part of the project.

For example, in a software project, some common milestones might include:

- **Requirements completion**: All necessary features and requirements for the software have been defined.
- **Design approval**: The software’s architecture and design are approved for development.
- **First working prototype**: A functional version of the software, even if limited in scope, is built and can be demonstrated.

=== Milestones vs. Releases in Software Management

In **software project management**, milestones and releases serve different purposes:

==== Milestone

- **Purpose**: A milestone marks the completion of a major phase or achievement, used for internal project tracking.
- **Focus**: Milestones are about tracking progress within the development cycle (such as completing a design or testing phase).
- **Time-bound**: They are often tied to specific dates but do not necessarily result in a product being delivered to users.
- **Example**: Reaching the end of the "feature development" phase or completing "beta testing."

==== Release

- **Purpose**: A release refers to a version of the software made available to the end-user, containing a set of completed features or fixes.
- **Focus**: Releases are focused on delivering usable software to stakeholders or customers.
- **Versioning**: Releases are typically versioned (e.g., v1.0, v2.0) and include new features, bug fixes, or performance improvements.
- **Example**: Releasing "Version 1.0" of the software for deployment to users.

==== Key Differences Between Milestones and Releases

|===
| **Aspect**       | **Milestone** | **Release** 
| **Purpose**      | Track progress and mark significant internal project achievements, such as completing algorithm development or model validation. | Deliver a working version of the scientific software to researchers, engineers, or end-users. 
| **Timing**       | Usually tied to internal deadlines like completing a computational model, feature development, or a simulation test. | Tied to external deadlines, often aligned with conference submissions, publication timelines, or public availability. 
| **Visibility**   | Mainly visible to internal teams (e.g., scientific programmers, computational researchers, project managers). | Visible to external stakeholders such as collaborating researchers, funding agencies, or general users. 
| **Scope**        | Focuses on completing scientific tasks like algorithm refinement, numerical validation, or model integration. | Focuses on delivering fully functional, validated, and potentially published software versions with new algorithms or models. 
| **Deliverable**  | Internal progress tracked, like a working prototype or a validated computational model, but not yet released to the broader scientific community. | A complete software release that includes new algorithms, models, or simulation capabilities made available to users for research or production use. 
| **Duration**     | No specific duration, marks key points in the research and development process (e.g., completion of the first draft of a new simulation method). | Includes a collection of features, bug fixes, or optimizations that have been developed and tested over a defined period. 
| **Example**      | Completing the validation of a new fluid dynamics solver or a complex climate model integration. | Release of a new version of the scientific software (e.g., "Version 2.0" with enhanced parallelization capabilities, or new solvers) for use by other researchers.

=== Summary

- A **milestone** is an internal progress marker that helps project teams track major achievements, while a **release** represents a specific version of the software delivered to users.
- In the context of software management, milestones help guide the project through its phases, while releases are tied to delivering finished products or features to the customer or end-users.
